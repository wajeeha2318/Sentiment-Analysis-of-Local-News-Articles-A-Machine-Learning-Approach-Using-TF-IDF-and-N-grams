# Sentiment Analysis of DAWN News
# Overview
In this project an in-depth sentiment analysis is done of news articles from DAWN News. The repository contains source code for both scraping data from the DAWN News website and performing sentiment analysis on the acquired data. The project includes various stages from data acquisition to model evaluation, utilizing advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models.

# Features
1. Web Scraper: Extracts news articles from the DAWN News website and stores the data in a .json file.
2. Data Preprocessing:
		Stop Words Removal: Filters out common stop words that do not contribute to the sentiment analysis.
    Lemmatization: Converts words to their base or root form.
    Tokenization: Splits text into individual words or tokens.
3. Sentiment Analysis:
		Polarity Score Calculation: Determines the sentiment polarity of sentences.
		TF-IDF Feature Selection: Uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to identify relevant features for sentiment analysis.
4. Machine Learning Models:
		Logistic Regression
		Naive Bayes
		Decision Tree
		Random Forest Classifier
		Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
# N-grams Analysis: Evaluates the effectiveness of n-grams in enhancing model training and accuracy in NLP tasks.
