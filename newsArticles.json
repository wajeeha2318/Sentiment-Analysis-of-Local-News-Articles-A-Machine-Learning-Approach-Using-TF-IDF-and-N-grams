of dengue virus in several thousand people, the health department has not imposed an emergency in Kech district and not provided proper treatment facilities for patients","43":"\u201cMost patients

suspected gunman, identified by Slovak media as 71-year-old poet Juraj Cintula, was placed in pre-trial detention by a special penal court in Pezinok northeast of the capital Bratislava on Saturday","54":"\u201cThe reason","55":"","56":"","57":"is concerns about a potential escape or that the criminal activity may continue,\u201d court spokeswoman Katarina Kudjakova said","58":"The

inconsistent economic policies, weak institutions, pervasive corruption, and lack of accountability has hit our country","67":"Add to that the gross mismanagement of scarce resources, the accumulation of unsustainable debt, and pathetic public service delivery, and it is no wonder that Pakistanis are losing trust in their government and state institutions","68":"Inequitable distribution of resources has created horizontal and vertical disparities","69":"Millions of people have fallen below the poverty line","70":"There is no social justice or equal opportunity","71":"Nor are people\u2019s basic needs being met or their human rights being respected","72":"Experts have written on what ails governance in Pakistan","73":"Studies have advised on how to extricate our economy from poor governance","74":"However, if one were to identify the root cause of these ills, it is not the economy but the way parliamentary democracy is practised here","75":"Take, for instance, the role of a ruling party MNA who has spent a certain amount of money on elections","76":"Ostensibly, his (or her) priorities would include: recovering the amount spent on the poll campaign, securing contracts and government jobs for his constituents; getting an executive position; and ensuring that the local government system does not take root lest development funds move out of his domain and end up with LG representatives","77":"None of these priorities relate to his actual responsibility of negotiating and legislating on public interest issues","78":"It is essentially no different if this MNA is in the opposition","79":"He would have to find a way to recoup the funds spent on his election campaign, or team up with like-minded colleagues to bring the government down","80":"Legislation is the least of his priorities","81":"A fragile political system cannot deliver","82":"The prime minister is a hostage to the MNAs","83":"If he does not facilitate the allocation of sufficient development funds for them, he runs the risk of a vote of no-confidence","84":"To remain in power, he looks around to seek help from other state institutions \u2014 the bureaucracy, judiciary, army \u2014 rather than leading them as chief executive of the country or inspiring their confidence to work within their respective mandates","85":"Such a fragile political system cannot deliver good governance","86":"One may ask why the parliamentary form of governance works well in countries like Japan, Italy and the Netherlands, where politics is nearly as unpredictable as it is in Pakistan","87":"A major reason is that these countries have not experienced military interventions in recent history, and the governance system has refined itself over electoral cycles","88":"The other reason is that their state institutions, particularly the bureaucracy, judiciary, and the armed forces, are not politicised, and maintain their independence and meritocracy","89":"An efficient and competent civil service coupled with an impartial judiciary is the steel frame that ensures the rule of law","90":"If these two institutions are functioning on the basis of merit, governance remains functional regardless of which political party is in power","91":"For Pakistan to take the road to good governance, the parliamentary form of government, as is being practised here, needs to be revisited","92":"The size of the provinces should be rationalised by increasing their number to facilitate better governance","93":"The resources devolved to them under the 18th Amendment should be transferred to the local level of governance","94":"We should also set up a national security council for integrated decision-making under the leadership of the elected prime minister","95":"However, these measures require national consensus and constitutional amendments, which would take a long time","96":"The focus, therefore, should be on doable measures that do not require constitutional amendments","97":"These would include: (i) setting up elected LGs for better public service delivery, and letting MNAs and MPAs devote their time to legislation; (ii) encouraging wealth creation by facilitating industrialisation and ease of doing business, and attracting domestic investors who have parked their capital abroad; (iii) working towards self-reliance: expect no foreign dole-outs, open up the SIFC framework for domestic investors, encourage industries that create employment, expedite economic zones, encourage import substitution, regulate food cartels, and encourage regional trade; (iv) not compromising on establishing the government\u2019s writ, otherwise investments won\u2019t come in; and (v) empowering the ECP to use electronic voting machines for transparent polls, and ensuring democratic practices within political parties","98":"A governance system that does not ensure the safety, security, dignity, and prosperity of ordinary citizens must be reformed","99":"The writer is chairman of Sanober Institute Islamabad","100":"Published in Dawn, May 19th, 2024","101":"Pakis\u00adtan\u2019s inaugural lunar satellite iCube-Qamar on

for South and Central Asia cautioned Pakistan against importing gas from Iran, as it would expose it to US sanctions","270":"In response, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch made a case for national sovereignty; since the pipeline is being built within Pakistani territory, \u201cwe do not believe that at this point there is room for any discussion or waiver from a

waiver, which \u201cwould require support from both Saudi Arabia and the UAE","285":"\u201dBut as tensions mount in the Middle East over the war in Gaza, with new US sanctions against Iran announced on April 18, Mr Kugelman said it was unlikely that the US would grant Pakistan a sanctions waiver to proceed with the project","286":"Economic feasibilityPakistan has around 19","287":"5 Tcf of proven

towards raising funds from international banks\u201d, Mr Zakaria warned that securing investment may prove challenging","290":"\u201cNeither the development finance institutions nor western and Middle Eastern banks will lend for the project in view of US sanctions placed on Iran, which will also make it difficult for Pakistan to pay for the gas received from Iran,\u201d he

April 20th, 2024","300":"Apathy, manipulation and intrigue seem to define Pakistan football","301":"While players and fans of football continue to rue the state of the sport in the country despite its undoubted popularity, the machinations in its governing body, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), paint a picture of those at the helm working for their own personal interests rather than for the good of its main stakeholders","302":"But now there seems to be an unholy nexus between such interests and parts of the global football governing body Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as well","303":"FIFA has suspended the country twice in the last decade alone \u2014 including over interference in the PFF elections","304":"Eventually, the world governing body resorted to a stopgap solution of appointing a \u201cNormalisation Committee\u201d (NC) in 2019","305":"It was given the explicit task to hold the PFF elections transparently, while managing football activities, including conducting regular domestic football tournaments, till the appointment of a new governing board","306":"But even this stopgap solution has now been mired in controversy, with the NC failing woefully short of meeting its mandate and getting multiple extensions to its tenure along the way","307":"One major criticism against this stopgap NC is that the man steering it \u2014 Pakistani-Canadian tech entrepreneur Haroon Malik \u2014 is trying to set up a franchise league, on similar lines as cricket\u2019s glitzy Pakistan Super League, at the expense of a club-based domestic league necessary for the grassroots development of the sport","308":"This Eos investigation will reveal how Malik is actively trying to engineer a situation that would enable him to continue exerting his influence over the PFF \u2014 even after his departure following elections for a new governing body \u2014 and how some of the highest-ranking officials in FIFA are part of an elaborate scheme to upend Pakistan football for their own gains","309":"Everyone agrees that Pakistan football needs a regular league system to provide a platform for local footballers and to capitalise on the growing fan interest in the sport","310":"But is a franchise system like cricket\u2019s PSL the best way forward","311":"And why is an interim football administration pushing for it","312":"FAR FROM NORMALISEDOn a breezy Ramazan night during the second week of March, two football teams took to a ground nestled in the hills to Karachi\u2019s north","313":"There was an extravagant ceremony before the match, with fireworks aplenty","314":"It was the opening match of the Ramazan Gold Cup","315":"Sights like these have become few and far between in Pakistan football and the PFF had nothing to do with it","316":"This tournament had been organised privately, with domestic football activity having become non-existent in the country","317":"The Pakistan Premier Football League (PPFL), the country\u2019s top-tier competition, hasn\u2019t been held by the PFF since 2018","318":"It\u2019s something that has irked Pakistan\u2019s history-making head coach Stephen Constantine","319":"Constantine \u2014 who has been demanding that the league be restarted \u2014 wasn\u2019t in attendance at the Naya Nazimabad Football Stadium, however","320":"The 61-year-old Englishman was in Lahore, overseeing the national team\u2019s preparations for its upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan","321":"A day earlier in Lahore, Constantine was visibly irate during an interaction with reporters","322":"Peppered with questions regarding Pakistan\u2019s chances against Jordan \u2014 who had recently ended as runners-up in the Asian Cup \u2014 the English coach was blunt and unforgiving","323":"Time and again, Constantine has reiterated that it is fundamentally important that Pakistan revives its league structure, which can allow local players to have regular competition","324":"Since taking up the job in October 2023, Constantine has been adamant that a functioning league would allow him to have a greater pool of local players to choose from, instead of working only with those at his disposal at the training camp","325":"He was merely repeating himself six months on","326":"He was also critical of the stopgap NC over the delay in organising the National Challenge Cup, an annual month-long football tournament, which was suspended after the group stages in January last year","327":"For him, the tournament could have been a starting point for the league","328":"\u201cI just heard there were 5,000 clubs in Pakistan,\u201d he said, referring to the results of the recent club scrutiny \u2014 disputed at several levels \u2014 carried out by the stopgap NC","329":"\u201cYou don\u2019t need every district to be part of the league","330":"We had a Challenge Cup with 32 teams","331":"Just take 16 teams from it and start the bloody league","332":"\u201dWhat Constantine doesn\u2019t know is that the PFF\u2019s internal problems aren\u2019t the only impediment to the revival and resumption of the domestic league","333":"More than a year before his appointment as the chairman of the FIFA appointed \u2018Normalisation Committee\u2019 in December 2021, Haroon Malik visited the FIFA headquarters in Zurich for a \u2018secret meeting\u2019 that would determine the future trajectory of Pakistan football","334":"GAMING THE SYSTEMTo be fair, Pakistan football suffers from a multitude of problems: from a decades-long power struggle over control of the federation, including a hostile takeover of its premises in 2021 \u2014 which resulted in a 15-month suspension of Pakistan by FIFA \u2014 to the lack of clarity over whether any future domestic league would be a club or departmental event, or if it would take place at all","335":"This is aside from national team players often going unpaid for months, and the country\u2019s and clubs\u2019 abysmal performance in international competitions","336":"The PFF has also failed on the administrative front, with elections for the new governing body not held in the three years since Malik was appointed to lead the stopgap NC","337":"One of the elections conducted by the stopgap NC, for the referee\u2019s association, remains disputed","338":"In another controversial decision, the PFF allowed newly registered clubs the right to vote \u2014 against the PFF Constitution \u2014 in the ongoing district elections","339":"These clubs were scrutinised as part of PFF\u2019s extensive programme to register clubs, the long-delayed first step towards holding elections","340":"A novel way of voting has also been introduced for the district elections, with votes to be cast through WhatsApp, which has raised further alarm among the footballing community","341":"There\u2019s a method to the madness, however","342":"Under the PFF constitution, registered clubs vote for district associations, which in turn vote for the provincial associations","343":"Three nominees each from the four provinces and one from Islamabad become part of the PFF Executive Committee (ExCo)","344":"The ExCo, comprising a total of 26 members, votes for the president","345":"Other relevant associations and groups, like that of the referees, also have one vote as do the eight departmental teams and the club that wins the women\u2019s national championship","346":"With a simple majority required to win, support from the provinces and Islamabad alone can tip the election in a candidate\u2019s favour","347":"With clubs \u2014 that had voting rights previously, when the last PFF election was held in 2015 \u2014 set to vote for the stakeholders who have been vying for power for the past several years, detractors have accused the NC of manipulating the still-to-be-held elections by including newly registered clubs","348":"The extent of the control the Haroon Malik-led governing body holds over the election has resulted in concerns over transparency","349":"In the meantime, the government has written to FIFA on multiple occasions, most recently in December, calling for a change in the NC over its failure to hold elections within the prescribed time","350":"Despite the vociferous complaints, FIFA gave Haroon Malik and his team another nine-month extension, in March this year","351":"To understand why Malik continues to enjoy FIFA\u2019s unwavering support and patronage, we have to rewind back to a year before Malik\u2019s appointment as the NC chairman in January 2021","352":"In retrospect, this provided the first glimpse of what was at play and how FIFA was committing the biggest foul on Pakistan football","353":"Malik\u2019s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league, only came to light after he was forced out\nof the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front","354":"Pakistan head coach Stephen Constantine with his players during a training session at the Naseer

knowledge of Haroon\u2019s elaborate plans of holding a league, or whether they were investigated during the eligibility checks, but added: \u201cFIFA has no further comment at this stage","421":"\u201d \n\nTAKING INSPIRATION FROM THE PSLIn 2015, Z2C helped launch the PSL","422":"Its affiliate, Blitz Advertising, was a broadcasting, live-streaming and a marketing partner for the league","423":"But the partnership fell apart due to a legal dispute in 2020, with the Pakistan Cricket Board claiming victory in its arbitration proceedings against Blitz over rights fee payments related to the PSL two years later","424":"Blitz has long harboured hopes of holding a football league on similar lines","425":"With football being an untapped market in Pakistan, with massive potential returns for the initiators, they aren\u2019t the only ones","426":"For some time, Badar \u201cBobby\u201d Refaie, the former director marketing of the PCB, seemed to be driving forward Z2C\u2019s football ambitions externally, even though he brushed it off as small talk in a conversation during a PSL match in 2021","427":"\u201cThey just can\u2019t get it together,\u201d he said","428":"Badar has been involved in almost every sport \u2014 from organising a tour of hockey legends to Pakistan to the National Volleyball Championships","429":"\u201cWorking on new ideas, beside PSL for your Sports projects [sic],\u201d he wrote to Merchant on a Facebook post in March 2019, adding three pictures: a group photo of former hockey stars with the chief of army staff, one of himself alongside squash great Jahangir Khan and another of Spanish football legend Carles Puyol waving to crowds at the National Stadium in Karachi, during the final of the 2019 PSL","430":"Puyol\u2019s visit to Karachi was part of a series of launch events for the World Soccer Stars which, in November 2019, saw him, Brazilian Kaka, Portuguese Luis Figo and Frenchman Nicolas Anelka play two exhibition matches in Pakistan","431":"Ahead of the PSL final in March that year, TouchSky \u2014 who were also behind the World Soccer Stars event \u2014 had inked a deal with the PFF, which was elected in 2018 following elections conducted on the orders of the Supreme Court and not recognised by FIFA, to organise two leagues: a franchise league and a rebranded version of the Pakistan Premier Football League","432":"The deal, and their plans, came crashing down when FIFA appointed the NC to oversee football affairs in Pakistan","433":"TouchSky tried to do a similar deal with the PFF NC of Haroon\u2019s predecessor Humza Khan, but were rebuffed","434":"ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES","435":"Haroon Malik\u2019s and Z2C\u2019s plans had already taken off the ground by then","436":"Visits to both AFC and FIFA had been completed","437":"And once Humza Khan resigned, Malik\u2019s path to take up the reins of the NC was cleared \u2014 thanks to support from Gallavotti, one of FIFA president Gianni Infantino\u2019s key advisers","438":"But Malik\u2019s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league \u2014 only came to light after he was forced out of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, Ashfaq Hussain Shah, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front","439":"That forcible takeover of PFF headquarters by Shah eventually saw FIFA ban Pakistan for 15 months","440":"Malik aired his views on franchise leagues after FIFA and UEFA crushed plans for a breakaway European Super League (ESL), which was in many ways akin to the franchise system common in American sports","441":"\u201cLooking at our club structures and history, there are multiple options here,\u201d Malik expressed on X, while delving into a discussion on the collapsed ESL","442":"\u201cA hybrid model transitioning into promotion\/relegation makes sense to me","443":"[America\u2019s] Major League Soccer, [Japan\u2019s] J-League is a good conversation starter","444":"\u201dMalik expanded on this: \u201cSo many possibilities","445":"Bottom line \u2014 either one is good for the players","446":"Get them playing","447":"Enablers: Fandom, Partnerships and Broadcast","448":"Not insurmountable","449":"\u201d When asked why a traditional league model \u2014 which would see the country\u2019s football club culture thrive \u2014 might not be better than a franchise league model for Pakistan, Haroon replied, \u201cWe are a ways away from club licensing, and regulations get stringent everywhere","450":"\u201dHowever, franchise leagues run for a short period of time, with little time to invest in grassroots football or academies","451":"Club football, on the other hand, runs through the calendar year, giving players the opportunity to get regular competitive football","452":"Moreover, club-based leagues have the system of relegation and promotion, which operate on sporting merit, while franchise leagues are closed competitions","453":"The Major League Soccer (MLS) \u2014 a franchise league system \u2014 has achieved huge popularity in the United States","454":"The MLS, however, runs like a regular league, filling up a calendar year","455":"In India, the Indian Super League had to eventually be expanded for it to become the country\u2019s national league","456":"Its current season, which began in September, will culminate\u00a0in\u00a0May","457":"Another concern is that franchise teams will take up a sizeable chunk of whatever sponsorship is on offer, leaving nothing for the clubs to fund their\u00a0programmes","458":"This is already a problem for Pakistani club sides","459":"With the PPFL largely made up of departments, and with none of the teams fulfilling AFC\u2019s club licensing regulations, Pakistan has been unable to send a representative to continental competitions","460":"Malik, however, believes that wouldn\u2019t be a concern for potential team owners in the model suggested by him","461":"\u201cSetting up the commercial model is key, adapted to our local market and the sporting culture here,\u201d he said during that exchange","462":"\u201cOnce that is done, everything is like Tetris, blocks falling into place","463":"\u201dMalik\u2019s conviction at that point seemingly stemmed from the fact that his plans were already underway, with FCPK set to take care of fandom and Z2C, with its huge portfolio of clients, making sure of partnerships and broadcast","464":"But the FIFA suspension broke that acceleration","465":"When Malik and members of his NC eventually returned after being handed back the PFF premises that had been taken over and the FIFA ban getting lifted in June 2022, they were given a further year to complete the mandate","466":"The NC was then given another extension until March 2024 and now has until December to complete the process","467":"Meanwhile, detractors insist that the extensions are part of a larger plan to consolidate Malik\u2019s control of the election process and the federation","468":"TIME TO TURN A CORNERSuch control over the election is key to bringing the league plan of Malik\u2019s Z2C, Gallavotti and Gai to fruition","469":"If a candidate they\u2019re backing comes into power, it would be easier to get the league rubber-stamped","470":"It would also ensure that the new PFF will effectively be run by former employees of Z2C","471":"\u201cGallavotti and Gai are part of FIFA\u2019s inner circle, closest to Infantino,\u201d one source in the global football body tells\u00a0Eos","472":"\u201cIf they want the league to happen, it will happen sooner or later","473":"\u201dFIFA\u2019s aim of appointing the NC was to have transparent elections of the PFF but that now seems to be turning into, in footballing terms, a red card offence","474":"The global football body can point to the fact that it was during the NC\u2019s tenure that Pakistan got past the first round of World Cup qualifying for the first time in history","475":"But, even if the league eventually begins, the damage caused to the country\u2019s domestic football scene during the last few years is unforgivable","476":"Earlier this year, the NC made a point of degrading three top-tier clubs of the country","477":"When the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) asked for nominees from Pakistan for the inaugural SAFF Club Championship, the NC shortlisted three clubs from Balochistan \u2014 Afghan FC, Muslim FC and Baloch FC \u2014 for the event","478":"A tournament between the trio was announced to select Pakistan\u2019s representative, but it never took place, as the clubs baulked at the financial guarantees the NC sought from them beforehand","479":"The NC later stated that the clubs weren\u2019t interested in participating at the SAFF event","480":"It goes back to what Malik said in that exchange on X about clubs not coming close to meeting licensing regulations","481":"Constantine, if he stays that long, will in all probability get a league for his players, but it may not be a club-based one","482":"As far as the clubs in the country are concerned, their fate seems to have been sealed by those in FIFA\u2019s inner circle","483":"The writer is Dawn\u2019s Sports Editor","484":"X: @UmaidWasimPublished

executives","551":"But recent viewing figures suggest the format may have had its day, and is certainly no longer the success story it once was","552":"The roots of reality TV in the UK can be traced back to the BBC\u2019s landmark 1974 documentary series The Family, which was one of the first fly-on-the-wall documentaries on British television","553":"But it was at the turn of the millennium, amid increased competition between broadcasters and audiences becoming fragmented between the growing number of content providers, that reality television really took off","554":"With reality TV in the UK almost dead, The Traitors offers a last glimmer of hopeSo-called \u201cdocusoaps\u201d, such as the BBC\u2019s Airport and Driving School in the late 1990s, combined elements of the

US-style confessional talk shows and televised social experiments, such as Channel 4\u2019s Big Brother","557":"Twenty years on, the golden age of reality TV may be over, as audiences

so","566":"Those wanting a dose of reality (or maybe mediated reality) now have a range of platforms from which to choose","567":"Social media platforms and podcasts now provide a similar window on the lives of \u201creal people","568":"\u201dAnother factor is that audiences have become more media literate in recent years","569":"There is greater awareness that shows in this genre are, in many cases, scripted and constructed, often with certain narratives created by means of editing","570":"Furthermore, viewers have become more aware of the effect these reality TV series can have on some participants","571":"In May 2019, for example, ITV\u2019s The Jeremy Kyle Show was taken off the air after one of its guests subsequently took their own life","572":"The show, which allowed guests to discuss personal and relationship problems openly, often used lie detector tests and paternity tests as programme features","573":"Such was the concern after the guest\u2019s death that the UK government\u2019s Department of Culture, Media and Sport launched an inquiry","574":"The controversy surrounding some of these shows continues long after their airing","575":"A new Channel 4

The Traitors in light of the overall decline in reality TV\u2019s popularity","585":"One reason may be the way the participants are selected","586":"A 2023 article in GQ magazine explained it like this: \u201cThe cast were \u2018normal\u2019 people of all ages and body types","587":"Not influencers or gym-goers primed for fame, but the kind of people who might know your mum from Zumba class, or work at the checkout in your local supermarket","588":"\u201dAnother reason may be that British audiences are fascinated by the duplicity and deception that runs through The Traitors","589":"Many of us engage with the \u201chyper-real\u201d nature of the show","590":"As sociologist Danielle Lindemann argues: \u201cIt\u2019s like our own lives but more extreme \u2014 a funhouse where everything is accentuated","591":"We all know liars in our lives, but probably not to this extreme","592":"\u201dTo its credit, reality TV has adapted and evolved to a multi-channel, multi-provider environment","593":"Big Brother, for example, moved from Channel 4 to Channel 5 in 2011 and then found a new home on ITV1 in 2023, with a companion discussion show on ITV2","594":"So, using further technological advances could be one way to address the fall in the genre\u2019s popularity","595":"Virtual and augmented reality experiences could, for example, offer audiences the chance to influence

was the same in Bakhar Jamali, with locals saying that it took more than a year for the flood waters to completely drain","620":"It also contaminated the few water sources they had at their disposal","621":"The rains also unleashed the fury of the rocks and boulders of the Kirthar Mountain, as huge pieces of stone slid down to the Kaachho area and destroyed the makeshift pathways and walking passages used by the people","622":"\u201cThe people have a strong bond with these mountains,\u201d says Jamali, adding that villagers get wood as well as hay and straw for their livestock

contribute to the region\u2019s development","648":"For Jamali, the solution is obvious","649":"It has to start with the basics, including ensuring that the children in the area have access to education and greater livelihood opportunities going forward","650":"Equally pressing is the issue of water availability, a desperate need of tubewells and solar-powered electricity, along with support to agriculturists and farmers in the area, who are still struggling to harvest their lands following the floods","651":"The villagers are very clear in what they need but they feel that their

creative direction, aesthetic shifts and more but at its core, the show lacks storytelling","742":"Initially, the plot geared us for introspection into the lives of the tawaifs of Heeramandi which swerves towards a Ram-Leela-level love affair and spirals into a Devdas-style revolution","743":"That\u2019s not to say Bhansali didn\u2019t do a lot right, the women of Heeramandi carry the narrative (minus our nepo baby Sharmin Segal who plays Alamzeb)","744":"Mallikajaan (Manisha Koirala) resides as the Huzoor (Madam) of Shahi Mahal \u2014 she would live and die for the women of

on-the-nose","752":"She reads him verses laced with a forced Urdu and passion that just didn\u2019t hit the mark","753":"While we do have mentions of Ghalib and Niazi, in a story that was meant to

knowledge","762":"The women were empowered to make their own choices and it was only after the onset of the British Raj when nawab culture was overthrown that Heeramandi became a home for sex workers","763":"It was a crux of cultural heritage, where people came to appreciate and learn the power of dance, music and poetry","764":"\u201cBoth the hereditary and newly trained tawa\u2019ifs strategically deployed their shared identity as skilled performers to rise in social status vis-\u00e0-vis their power dynamic with the patrons","765":"Apart from their artistic expertise, an

era (through Heeramandi)","770":"And while pieces of this history are entwined in the story, the sad reality is the lack of the raw oppression of these spaces shown in Heeramandi","771":"It almost seems to be glamourised by fairy dust where the oppression never reaches the light \u2014 the khalas and aapas and ammis of Heeramandi are decked in jewels and lavish clothes and the suffering that should have soaked the narrative is overly glamorised","772":"The perfection that emanates from the walls of Heeramandi is almost uncomfortable","773":"While patrons of art, their destinies are tied

Heeramandi woman adorns her ghungroo once she has had her debut as a tawaif","779":"Bhansali highlights the sublime, yet sweeping over the human experience to make it transcendental and evocative acts as an erasure of important stories; the plight of the women of Heeramandi (their pain, their living conditions), the Muslims living in the Subcontinent (their disconnect is confusing) and the language (the poor pronunciation and lack of fluidity of dialogue)","780":"In a lot of fiction, the body is used as a metaphor for society","781":"And Bhansali\u2019s period drama is no different","782":"There was room to delve into the body politics of 1940s India and comment on the lives of the tawaifs \u2014 the overarching male gaze on one hand, the ability to speak freely of sexuality on another \u2014 where does the conversation lead","783":"There is a layered focus on desire within the story and while the tawaifs themselves have their own desires, we only see the one reflected back to us through the male gaze","784":"During this period, the arts were deeply connected to social class and identity (the courtesans and creators on one hand and the entertained on the other) \u2014 a transactional relationship that was steeped in the fabric of society","785":"Music and dance act as tools to create communities and the tawaifs played a large role in that \u2014 one that must not be brushed over","786":"Music became a part of the social construction of identity at the time and yet the show doesn\u2019t seem to aid that narrative","787":"Maybe Bhansali wanted to create a story that appealed to a greater audience but let\u2019s not forget that women are the backbone of every form of creation","788":"The tawaifs and their journeys will not be forgotten, no matter the glamour used to doll it up","789":"Every story about a woman is a story of resistance","790":"The end of the series was beautiful and powerful and probably one of the few scenes that left an imprint on me","791":"The closing narration: \u201cLike birds in gilded cages, these tawaifs knew the value of freedom\u2026But a woman\u2019s struggle never ends\u201d served as the perfect culmination to a series that relied so heavily upon being perfect","792":"And while Heeramandi explored a facet of that resistance, it too remained akin to a bird in a gilded cage, never truly showing us the cost of freedom","793":"KATHMANDU: Former Nepali cricket captain Sandeep Lamic\u00adhhane had his conviction and eight-year sentence for rape quashed on appeal on Wednesday and was cleared to resume his

not only has the struggle for necessities like public transport and clean water become a daily battle, but the rising air pollution has made breathing difficult too","880":"Amid these difficulties, one artist has proposed an innovative solution to combat the city\u2019s increasingly unbreathable air: planting air purifiers in homes","881":"Fayaz Baloch, who hails from Kalat, Balochistan, fondly recalled his upbringing in a house adorned with a vast garden, where discussions about plants were commonplace during evening teas","882":"Reflecting on his journey, Baloch shared: \u201cI was a rebellious teenager until an almond tree taught me patience","883":"\u201d Breaking into a smile, he reminisced, \u201cIt just stood there, enduring the changing seasons, adapting to survive storms, heatwaves, and harsh winters","884":"Sometimes it looked mesmerising, other times bare","885":"\u201dBaloch\u2019s perspective further solidified when he moved to Karachi for the Taaza Tareen Residency offered by Vasl Artists\u2019 Association, delving into the city\u2019s historic neighbourhoods with a mission to address the challenges confronting local communities","886":"During his exploration, one observation stood out \u2014 the glaring absence of green spaces and plants","887":"Moreover, the poor air quality that pervaded the city\u2019s atmosphere became increasingly evident to Baloch with each passing day","888":"Based on the Air Quality Index (AQI), Karachi\u2019s current air quality registers at 98 US AQI","889":"The AQI serves as a universal metric endorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), allowing for comparisons of air pollution levels across different cities worldwide","890":"At this level, the air quality in Karachi is classified as moderate, indicating that it is generally acceptable","891":"However, individuals with respiratory conditions may experience some difficulty breathing particularly during the winter months when the quality becomes much worse","892":"To tackle these challenges, the solution seemed straightforward \u2014 Karachi\u2019s grey cemented spaces needed a splash of greenery","893":"With this idea in mind, Baloch set out to explore the city","894":"During one of his expeditions to Jodia Bazaar, a bustling local market, the artist stumbled upon a unique sight","895":"In a small shop tucked away in the chaos, the owner had ingeniously suspended his collection of kettles from the ceiling","896":"\u201cIt intrigued me how he utilised every inch of his space,\u201d the artist remarked, captivated by the creative use of such a seemingly mundane setting","897":"Limited spaces II, Jodia Bazaar, Karachi \u2014 Fayaz Baloch\nAnother thing that caught his attention was the abundance of towering skyscrapers, each seemingly striving to outdo the other in height","898":"Among them, the structures under construction stood out with their wooden scaffolding giving an illusion of the building, set to grace the skyline in a matter of months","899":"\u201cIn Karachi, land is a precious commodity, nobody wants to give up even 25 square feet space for a neem tree which grows well in Karachi\u2019s environment without any need of special care because why would they loose out on millions of rupees,\u201d Baloch noted","900":"In recent years, Karachi, often dubbed the \u201ccity of lights,\u201d has undergone a dramatic transformation, marked by rapid progress","901":"However, alongside this urban evolution, there\u2019s a decline in the city\u2019s natural spaces","902":"\u201cWhat Karachiites fail to realise is that humans can\u2019t live without nature,\u201d he lamented","903":"Limited spaces II, Saddar, Karachi \u2014 Fayaz Baloch\n\u201cWith this vision, I wanted a common person to talk about the environment and understand the problem,\u201d said Baloch","904":"To ensure relatability, he decided to incorporate scaffolding structures \u2014a familiar sight for every resident of the city","905":"However, merging these structures with plants posed a challenge","906":"The search led him to Hydroponics Pakistan Company, which introduced him to aeroponics \u2014 the practice of growing plants in air or misty environments without the use of soil","907":"\u201cThe NASA-approved plants require no soil, which helps in avoiding the health risks that come with the use of insects and pesticides,\u201d explained Khalid Fazli, head of research and development, at Pakistan Hydroponics","908":"He elaborated that these plants are primarily designed for indoor spaces","909":"\u201cThey\u2019re like air purifiers, but even more effective as they not only cleanse the air but also replenish it with oxygen","910":"\u201d\u201cThese plants typically grow upwards, but for the artist\u2019s vision, we displayed them upside down,\u201d Fazli noted","911":"Anybody can plant them in their homes; the only worry is that they require a nutrient-enriched solution and a small water pumping motor that can regularly supply the plant with the mist it needs","912":"\u201cWhen you water the soil once, it retains the water and provides it to the plant as needed; as there is no soil here, the water needs to be provided to it in regular intervals,\u201d Fazli added","913":"\u201cI suspended the plants upside down to capture the interest of ordinary individuals and spark conversations","914":"It proved to be effective; as soon as people noticed the downward-facing leaves, they approached me to inquire about the unusual display and its significance,\u201d said Baloch, recalling the two days his installation was displayed at the Aga Khan University Hospital","915":"Project Installation at Aga Khan University Hospital \u2014 Fayaz Baloch\n\u201cThe climate is changing rapidly, the reality is that we can\u2019t stop progression but what we can do is think innovatively \u2014 \u2018Future Gardens: Utopian Solution for Uncertain Future\u2019 was exactly about that,\u201d Baloch emphasised","916":"However, innovation is not the solution to this problem","917":"\u201cThese plants are a step forward, but let\u2019s not mistake them for a victory,\u201d remarked environmentalist Tofiq Pasha Mooraj","918":"\u201cIf we become content with these artificial substitutes that look like pictures on a wall, then we risk losing real trees, birds, and flowers","919":"\u201dMooraj stressed that the true solution lies in reclaiming green spaces and safeguarding the ones we have","920":"\u201cThese plants are not trees yet; it will take time for them to reach that stage","921":"In the meantime, we must shield ourselves from the imminent threat, such as the ongoing environmental degradation, by taking small steps like reducing plastic usage","922":"\u201dAs Karachi navigates its path toward a sustainable future, Baloch\u2019s vision serves as a reminder that the solutions to our most pressing challenges often lie at the intersection of creativity, perseverance, and a deep reverence for the natural world","923":"His story is a testament to the power of art to inspire change and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity","924":"Header image: Art installation by Fayaz Baloch \u2014 AKUH","925":"THE Pakistan-Afghanistan frontier has witnessed another series of flare-ups, this time in the Kurram tribal district that borders several Afghan provinces","926":"The hostilities indicate the need for better border management from both sides, so that minor disputes do not descend into armed exchanges","927":"Thankfully a ceasefire was agreed to on Saturday, with the border reopening","928":"Earlier, those living in border villages had moved to safer locales as forces from both states traded fire","929":"Trade activities at the Kharlachi crossing had also been suspended","930":"The trigger for the escalation remains unclear","931":"Though the Taliban remained tight-lipped, Afghan media claimed a number of \u201ccivilians\u201d had lost their lives in the clashes, which had been continuing for several days but intensified on Friday","932":"Pakistan\u2019s cross-border issues with Afghanistan are of two kinds","933":"The first involves direct hostilities between security forces of both nations","934":"The second element is that of cross-border terrorism perpetrated in Pakistan by militant groups that have apparently found sanctuary in Afghanistan","935":"Both these outstanding issues need to be resolved in order to ensure mutual security","936":"While some in official circles had felt that security would improve after the Western-backed government in Kabul fell and the Taliban took over, this has not been the case","937":"Ever since the August 2021 fall of Kabul, cross-border security has remained tenuous","938":"The number of incidents over the past several months is numerous","939":"For example, the Torkham crossing has remained closed for days on end due to various disputes","940":"Sometimes these closures have taken a violent turn, with security forces trading fire","941":"Pakistan has also struck reported terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan; the last major such incident took place in March after a number of security personnel were martyred in a North Waziristan ambush","942":"Meanwhile, a terrorist incursion in Chitral was thwarted by security forces in September last year","943":"While Pakistan has communicated its \u201cdeepest concerns\u201d to Kabul regarding the latest hostilities, there is a need to work with the de facto Afghan government to ensure the western border remains peaceful","944":"Local-level disputes at the frontier need to be resolved by area commanders and officials before they deteriorate into exchanges of fire","945":"Moreover, the Afghan side must realise that the Durand Line is the border, and change in its status is non-negotiable from the Pakistani point of view","946":"The issue of cross-border terrorism is more complicated","947":"While the Taliban authorities may be in denial about the presence of militants on Afghan soil, securing the border \u2014 and ensuring no anti-Pakistan terrorists are able to threaten this country\u2019s security from the Afghan side \u2014 is the Taliban\u2019s responsibility","948":"While it may appear that Islamabad\u2019s antiterrorism concerns are not being seriously entertained by Kabul, the state must continue to use diplomatic channels to communicate its views","949":"Published in Dawn, May 19th, 2024","950":"Apple launched a new series of

demolished and sealed in different districts of the city, it added","993":"The SBCA had last month announced to launch operation against the illegal buildings across Karachi","994":"The orders came days after the Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani visited the SBCA headquarters and asked the authority to stop illegal constructions in Karachi, given the fact that illegal buildings created a mess in any city","995":"Earlier this week, the Association of Builders and Developers (ABAD) in a meeting with SBCA DG assured its support for the ongoing demolition campaign against illegal constructions","996":"During the meeting, the ABAD delegation highlighted various challenges encountered by the construction industry, emphasising the importance of collaboration between the private

digital era, warping public perceptions and jeopardising fundamental democratic structures","1006":"It undermines the integrity of informed public discourse and governance, posing critical challenges to the foundational principles of truth and transparency in our interconnected societies","1007":"A subtler yet profoundly impactful fallout of digital disinformation is its utility as a tool for higher content-control, cloaking overt censorship under the guise of \u2018protecting citizens from online harms\u2019","1008":"This pretext of safeguarding the public, or curtailing the spread of false information \u2018in the public interest\u2019, often serves as a convenient facade for targeted bans, or even blanket censorship, by both governments and social media companies","1009":"Paradoxically, censorship itself often acts as a significant catalyst for the proliferation of digital disinformation, particularly the kind that can distort democratic processes and shape public opinion","1010":"This form of control enables dominant narratives to flourish unchallenged, simultaneously silencing dissenting voices and alternative perspectives, thus skewing public perception and undermining the very essence of democratic dialogue","1011":"A case study illustrating the impact of digital censorship on the spread of disinformation is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict","1012":"The conflict has been plagued by significant misinformation, disseminated through various channels such as misleading narratives, out-of-context imagery, and false claims across multiple platforms","1013":"Human Rights Watch has documented instances where posts advocating for Palestinian rights were either hidden or received notably diminished engagement on platforms like Instagram and Facebook","1014":"This practice, often termed \u2018shadow banning\u2019, effectively limits the visibility of pro-Palestinian voices","1015":"In my view, this silencing of pro-Palestinian voices has substantially contributed to the spread of disinformation","1016":"These actions can distort public discourse and affect how people perceive a certain conflict, potentially influencing public opinion and international policy decisions based on incomplete or biased information","1017":"In recent months, Pakistan\u2019s decision to suspend the social media platform X has spotlighted a critical issue: while intended to curb disinformation, such measures can paradoxically foster an environment where misinformation thrives more freely","1018":"This development offers a poignant example of how censorship, rather than containing disinformation, might actually exacerbate it","1019":"Social media platforms like X play a crucial role in the modern public sphere","1020":"They enable the rapid dissemination of information, facilitate public engagement, and allow for the communal vetting of facts and ideas","1021":"This interactive ecosystem is pivotal in debunking falsehoods and fostering informed communities","1022":"When access to such platforms is restricted, it disrupts these processes, removing a public tool for fact verification and debate","1023":"Consequently, misinformation can migrate to less regulated and more opaque channels, such as public and private WhatsApp groups, spreading without the counterbalance of community scrutiny or expert fact-checking","1024":"The handling of the X blockage by regulatory bodies and the government is a reminder of how misinformation is manipulated for political ends","1025":"Journalistic fact-checking outlets, or even individual, credible journalists who regularly debunk misinformation, serve as the critical first line of defence against digital disinformation, rigorously scrutinising and debunking false narratives that permeate online spaces","1026":"They are essential in the fight against digital disinformation, considering the broad reach and real-time nature of social media platforms","1027":"They use these platforms not just to debunk false claims but also to educate the public on recognising and questioning misinformation","1028":"The suspension of X in Pakistan has significantly handicapped these efforts","1029":"The handling of the X platform blockage by regulatory bodies and the federal government serves as a stark reminder of how misinformation is often manipulated for political ends","1030":"The sudden and unexplained blocking of the platform left both the public and the media in a state of confusion, as the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority remained tight-lipped and evasive in its communications","1031":"Even when the ban faced legal challenges in the Sindh High Court, a PTA representative confidently asserted that the platform was operational, going as far as to demonstrate its functionality on his mobile phone","1032":"It was only after sustained legal pressure that the PTA reluctantly submitted a document to the Sindh High Court, revealing a letter from the interior ministry directing the blockage of X","1033":"However, the credibility of this document is marred by discrepancies in dates and other key details","1034":"Legal battles over the X ban are ongoing in the high courts with the interior ministry stubbornly citing online harms as the primary justification for the ban","1035":"In a report submitted to the Islamabad High Court on April 17, the interior ministry attempted to link the ban to the \u201cmisuse of the platform\u201d, claiming it was essential for upholding security, \u201cmaintaining public order, and preserving the integrity of our nation\u201d","1036":"The report further accused X of being a potential catalyst for \u201cchaos and instability\u201d and condemned its failure to address \u201cdefamatory campaigns\u201d","1037":"These allegations, however, overlook a critical aspect of digital and social media platforms; while they can indeed be used to spread disinformation, they also serve as crucial tools for countering and responding to such campaigns, and countering harmful disinformation","1038":"By cutting off mainstream access to X, the government has inadvertently created an environment where misinformation can thrive unopposed, particularly in less public spaces like WhatsApp groups","1039":"This restriction severely hampers the ability of fact-checkers to reach and correct public misconceptions, allowing disinformation to spread unchecked and unchallenged","1040":"To effectively combat disinformation without resorting to heavy-handed censorship, governments should consider alternative strategies that focus on transparency, public education, and collaboration with technology platforms governed by principles of human rights, transparency and multistakeholderism","1041":"Enhancing media literacy among the populace \u2014 or \u2018inoculating\u2019 them against disinformation \u2014 can empower individuals to critically analyse and question the information they encounter","1042":"Through such collaborations, governments can develop more nuanced strategies that address disinformation while respecting freedom of expression","1043":"Inversely, when official channels suppress communication, people may turn to less credible sources, potentially increasing their exposure to disinformation","1044":"The writer is a media strategist and trainer, and founder of Media Matters for Democracy, a media development organisation","1045":"Published in Dawn, April

economy","1092":"It worked, and today, Vietnam has a sizeable population of coffee shops across the country","1093":"Much of the culture at Vietnamese coffee shops involves sitting down and relaxing","1094":"The chairs are very low \u2014\u00a0you\u2019re almost crouching down \u2014\u00a0and no one asks you to get up once you\u2019re done with your drink","1095":"I saw people relaxing at coffee shops at all odd hours of the day \u2014\u00a0at 11am, 2pm, 6pm and even 12am","1096":"Interestingly, the chairs always seem to be angled towards the road rather than in circles where you\u2019re facing your companions","1097":"It seemed like that seating arrangement was preferred because I saw very few people moving their chairs to face their friends","1098":"It also made for a more interesting experience for solo patrons, of which there were many","1099":"People sitting at coffee shops alone were easily able to avoid conversation and people-watch","1100":"In Pakistan, the experience of sitting alone at a coffee shop isn\u2019t half as interesting","1101":"I went to quaint roadside cafes, and some very cute gentrified cafes and while the aesthetics may differ, the coffee didn\u2019t really","1102":"By and large, coffee is quite cheap in Vietnam","1103":"Depending on where you go, you can get a glass of iced coffee for anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 Vietnamese dong (approximately Rs327 to Rs1,092)","1104":"The highest price we found was at the airport, but that\u2019s to be expected because airports are known for insane prices","1105":"The first couple of things I noticed about coffee in Vietnam is how unpretentious it is","1106":"In a world that values aroma and notes and God knows what else, this was a glass of iced coffee given to you at a roadside cafe with no fuss","1107":"It wasn\u2019t too rich (I did warn you that I am not a coffee connoisseur","1108":") and it wasn\u2019t  too bitter","1109":"It was exactly what I wanted \u2014\u00a0a fun, icy, sweet drink on a hot day","1110":"One interesting thing to note is that Vietnamese coffee, or at least the coffee I tried, didn\u2019t use milk","1111":"I\u2019m lactose intolerant so I attempted to cross question the barista on their milk options but Google Translate failed me and I had to put my trust in them","1112":"I later found out that a lot of coffee in Vietnam relies more on condensed milk and water than it does actual milk, which was my cue to pack away my Lactaid and try almost everything","1113":"I\u2019ll start with the OG \u2014\u00a0Vietnamese iced coffee or C\u00e0 Ph\u00ea S\u1eefa \u0110\u00e1","1114":"To put it simply, this was a basic and yummy drink","1115":"It\u2019s basic, it\u2019s mildly sweet and it\u2019s a fun drink to pick up on your way anywhere","1116":"I don\u2019t really like coconut, so I don\u2019t know what I was thinking ordering coconut coffee","1117":"I think my initial instinct had something to do with coconut milk as a dairy substitute, but as I mentioned earlier, it turned out that there were no substitutes necessary","1118":"The two coconut coffees I had were very different \u2014\u00a0the second was garnished with little coconut bits that made it grittier","1119":"The added texture was very nice","1120":"Overall, not just something for coconut lovers \u2014 even fans of a coconut existence would like it","1121":"I ordered this completely prepared to dislike it \u2014\u00a0why would I, a connoisseur of sweet icy drinks want a salty drink","1122":"\u2014 but it was actually really interesting","1123":"The salt added an interesting element to the coffee that I\u2019ve never experienced before","1124":"It wasn\u2019t a sweet drink but it was a fun one","1125":"It also didn\u2019t taste like seawater \u2014 which is what I was concerned about","1126":"This iced mocha coffee was my least favourite, perhaps because of how basic it was","1127":"It tasted chocolatey and like something you could get in Karachi","1128":"When I Googled food in Vietnam, one of the things at the top of everyone\u2019s lists was egg coffee","1129":"Apologies for a truly terrible picture of a truly delightful drink\nA

who worked at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hotel in Hanoi, whisked an egg into the coffee and created one of Hanoi\u2019s most popular treats","1131":"It seems the hot version of this coffee is more popular because most places I went to in Hanoi weren\u2019t offering iced egg coffee","1132":"I loved that even their egg coffee had a history","1133":"Visiting Vietnam meant learning a lot about its war and the ingenuity of the Vietnamese people, so is it any surprise that that ingenuity extended to their food as well","1134":"But while I appreciated the history, I was quite hesitant to try it","1135":"I\u2019ll be the first to acknowledge how gross this coffee sounds \u2014\u00a0raw egg in your coffee","1136":"Absolutely not","1137":"But when you think about it, raw egg can be used in a lot of different ways when it comes to dessert, like meringue","1138":"With that in mind I tried egg coffee and let me tell you, it is SWEET","1139":"The foamy cream is incredibly sweet and sits atop a layer of pretty bitter coffee","1140":"You have to mix it well otherwise you\u2019re getting the worst of both worlds","1141":"Honestly, this was my favourite coffee","1142":"It has even inspired me to try making iced egg coffee in Karachi","1143":"There was something about the sweet drink that was so fun \u2014\u00a0it was like a dessert","1144":"And it didn\u2019t have an eggy smell or taste, which is what I was afraid of","1145":"For the sake of this article, I\u2019ll pretend that I actually ordered hot egg coffee and my order wasn\u2019t just lost in translation","1146":"I think the iced version of this drink was far superior, but then again, I\u2019m biased","1147":"The moral of this story \u2014\u00a0go to Vietnam and try their coffee","1148":"A French road safety association

with negativity when discussing or even mentioning anything about periods","1514":"\u201cDuring my college days, I felt the need to conceal the fact that I was menstruating","1515":"This was mainly because of the attitudes of the college staff and a few peers","1516":"Menstruation was considered a significant taboo, and individuals were often targeted and bullied because of it,\u201d she said","1517":"\u201cOn another occasion, one of my colleagues began menstruating while at work, and it was earlier than expected","1518":"Given that we were working alongside about 30 male colleagues, it was necessary to keep this situation hidden from them","1519":"\u201dSara experienced period shaming herself","1520":"\u201cLike people saying, \u2018she\u2019s so outspoken, how can she talk about na-paki (impurity)","1521":"\u2019 When my father passed away, my sister happened to be on her period","1522":"To our astonishment, a few people attempted to prevent her from seeing our father [for the last time]","1523":"\u201dFor Aisha*, a 24-year-old blogger and researcher, the negativity and judgement came from women as well","1524":"\u201cWhen I started my foundation, aiming to provide not only free education but also awareness sessions educating women about menstrual hygiene, I encountered a challenging beginning,\u201d she narrated","1525":"\u201cInitially, despite extending invitations, women hesitated to attend these sessions, and some even responded with offensive language","1526":"However, I was determined not to let these rejections and failures define my efforts","1527":"Instead, I chose to confront the obstacles","1528":"My goal has always been to bring about a positive transformation, and this commitment drove me to persist in the face of setbacks,\u201d she said","1529":"\u201cDuring my menstrual cycle, I faced a range of restrictions \u2014 no sour foods, no playing, and strict prohibition from interacting with boys","1530":"These limitations were imposed upon me without exception,\u201d shared Aamna*, a 35-year-old housewife","1531":"\u201cThe societal taboo surrounding periods is fuelled by various cultural or religious beliefs, each with its own specificities","1532":"For instance, girls who are menstruating might be forbidden from entering the kitchen or even touching items like pickles","1533":"These practices are deeply ingrained in our society and culture, contributing to the overall stigma associated with menstruation","1534":"\u201dSomiayah Hafeez, a media fellow at the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law, and Development, 2023, offered a glimpse into her journey","1535":"\u201cI remember there were times when I was reeling from severe menstrual cramps but I was told to not wail or cry out loud \u2014\u00a0my cramps can get very excruciating and last for hours at a stretch, making it impossible not to cry \u2014 so that no one hears it","1536":"\u201cI can not work on the first and last day because my cramps are unbearable","1537":"I haven\u2019t sought medical help because everyone around me who faces a similar type of excruciating pain has been told by gynaecologists \u2018it will get better when you have a kid\u2019","1538":"\u201dPsychophysiologist Syeda Farah Batool highlighted the pressing need for open dialogue and comprehensive education regarding menstrual hygiene","1539":"\u201cWomen often encounter social stigma, discrimination, and misinformation, which hinders their ability to manage their menstrual health effectively,\u201d she explained","1540":"\u201cAdditionally, the high cost of menstrual products further exacerbates the issue, forcing many women to resort to unhygienic alternatives, risking their health and well-being","1541":"Addressing these challenges necessitates comprehensive education, improved infrastructure, and open dialogue to normalise conversations around menstrual hygiene","1542":"\u201dCreating an environment where conversations about menstruation are normalised is essential","1543":"When open discussions about menstrual health become part of everyday conversations, it helps break down stigmas and dispel misinformation","1544":"That\u2019s what grass-root movements like Mahwari Justice aim to achieve","1545":"Started off as a campaign to supply menstrual relief products to women affected by the floods in Pakistan, Mahwari Justice aims to challenge the silence and shame around menstruation","1546":"\u201cOur state is very patriarchal in nature","1547":"On one hand it glorifies bloodshed, wars and killings, but on the other, it stigmatises periods, and gives us this message that periods are impure and dirty,\u201d said Bushra Mahnoor, the founder of Mahwari Justice","1548":"\u201cIt also tells us that acquiring period products is a luxury","1549":"Because the state imposes a luxury tax on period products","1550":"Mahwari Justice is actively working to fight the luxury tax that is imposed on period products","1551":"\u201dMahnoor explained that in addition to addressing disasters and crises, they also employ unconventional methods such as creating rap songs and designing superhero comics to facilitate open discussions about menstruation","1552":"\u201cOur comics are available in Urdu, English and Sindhi","1553":"Currently, we are working on mahwari games to promote period positivity","1554":"\u201dMahwari Justice isn\u2019t the only organisation working to challenge period taboos \u2014\u00a0a group of students from Habib University have created a chatbot initiative called MAI to promote factual information about menstrual health","1555":"However, despite all these initiatives, I think major change can only come from openly addressing the topic in the mainstream media","1556":"We must strive to bring the topic of menstruation to the forefront of our mainstream media","1557":"That doesn\u2019t mean simply rolling out the occasional ad featuring sad, downtrodden women gazing out of windows, as if longing to be part of an unreachable universe, and then implying that using any particular period product will transport them to a galaxy beyond the Milky Way","1558":"We need to create films and TV shows that openly and thoughtfully address the topic of menstruation","1559":"By doing so, we can contribute to normalising conversations about menstruation and breaking the stigma surrounding it","1560":"Our production houses should aim to educate, raise awareness, and foster empathy by portraying realistic and relatable experiences related to menstruation","1561":"While there is always a place for stories that feature the Murtasims, Ashers, and Hamzas of the world, it is also important to occasionally delve into the subject of menstruation directly","1562":"This approach will not only be beneficial but can also contribute to the ratings of these productions","1563":"Because this type of content hasn\u2019t been explored previously in our cinematic landscape, some novelty in storytelling will engage audiences in a unique and meaningful way","1564":"Drawing inspiration from successful shows like Udaari (sexual abuse), Rehaai (child marriage), Mor Moharaan (climate change) and Dur Si Jati Hai Sila (victim blaming), which have tackled important social issues in the past, we can build upon their success and create narratives that delve into menstruation directly","1565":"These shows have proven their ability to captivate audiences, spark conversations, and address societal taboos","1566":"By extending this approach to menstrual health, we can educate, empower, and normalise conversations around this natural aspect of life","1567":"We don\u2019t need to look too far for examples for content related to menstruation","1568":"We can find numerous instances across the border, where one of Bollywood\u2019s leading actors, Akshay Kumar, not only starred in a film like Pad-Man but also actively worked to spread awareness about menstruation","1569":"This is particularly significant in countries like India and Pakistan, because we are a nation that keenly follows our actors","1570":"Whether it\u2019s emulating their hairstyles or supporting causes endorsed by them, their influence holds substantial weight","1571":"If popular Pakistani stars like Fawad Khan, Fahad Mustafa, or Humayun Saeed were to work in a drama that spreads awareness about menstruation, it would greatly enhance its reach and impact","1572":"Production houses should consider shifting their focus towards creating content that addresses important social issues like menstruation, rather than solely producing saas-bahu sagas or fairytale romances","1573":"By delving into topics that are relevant to real-life experiences and have a social impact, they can contribute to positive change and promote awareness","1574":"Such content can also help break down taboos, challenge misconceptions, and foster a more inclusive and progressive society","1575":"It can provide a platform to explore the experiences of women and empower them by giving voice to their stories","1576":"It is crucial for production houses to recognise the potential impact of creating content that addresses social issues and actively embrace the opportunity to educate, empower, and inspire positive change through their storytelling","1577":"*Some names have been changed to protect the privacy of the women interviewed","1578":"LE MANS: MotoGP

it\u2019s in the last four km, so I was waiting, waiting, waiting on the last climb and when I saw the last 3km, I attacked,\u201d Paret-Peintre said","1722":"Romain Bardet (Team DSM-Firmenich) made

then noted that after Vawda, Kamal also made statements, mentioning former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto","1789":"\u201cIf we are in the wrong, then tell us,\u201d he said, recalling that the Supreme Court had \u201cacknowledged its mistake\u201d in the case of Bhutto\u2019s hanging","1790":"\u201cDo not attack at every matter; you are destroying the institution,\u201d Justice Isa stated","1791":"\u201cThere is only one job; to defame the institutions","1792":"You worked hard by making a speech but no one takes the written route for betterment,\u201d he remarked","1793":"\u201cIf you have to make speeches then do so in the Parliament","1794":"Why in the press club","1795":"\u201d the chief justice wondered, noting that both Vawda and Kamal were

point, Justice Isa asked who would be the prosecutor if proceedings of contempt of court were held, at which the AAG replied that the attorney general of Pakistan would be the prosecutor","1800":"The top judge then asked AAG Rehman, \u201cNow, it is upon your shoulders","1801":"Should a show-cause notice be issued or only a notice","1802":"\u201d\u201cEvery citizen of the country is part of the judiciary","1803":"[\u2026] Mistakes were made [but] we have to accept them and move ahead,\u201d he remarked","1804":"The chief justice then issued notices to Vawda and Kamal, seeking clarification

observed that in retrospect, the two lawmakers had committed contempt of court","1807":"The apex court also sought the video recordings and transcripts of both politicians\u2019 press conferences from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra)","1808":"Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till June 5","1809":"In April, Susan Hall, the Conservative Party\u2019s candidate to replace London\u2019s Labour mayor Sadiq Khan, posted a photograph on X (formerly Twitter) that Khan was planning to charge motorists for every mile that they would drive in the capital \u2014 already one of the most expensive places in the world to drive a car in","1810":"The claims were shared and reposted gleefully by Conservative supporters, columnists and even a handful of Tory MPs","1811":"But it was a lie","1812":"Khan has categorically ruled out the so-called \u201cPay-Per-Mile\u201d scheme and the picture that Hall had tweeted was Photoshopped","1813":"Despite repeatedly being called out for her lies, Hall doubled down and then released a video repeating the claim","1814":"Making false claims about your opponents has been a part of political discourse around the world for decades \u2014 especially around election time \u2014 but it appears that, after 14 years in power, such tactics are all that\u2019s left for Britain\u2019s Conservatives and their beleaguered leader, Rishi Sunak","1815":"When he was anointed Britain\u2019s first Indian-origin prime minister in October 2022, it was hailed as a celebration of Britain\u2019s progressive, multicultural democracy","1816":"More importantly, after the buffoonery and chaos of the Boris Johnson and Liz Truss months, Sunak promised \u201cintegrity\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d","1817":"Why Rishi Sunak, the great hope of multicultural Britain, fell flat and is about to fizzle outInstead, his administration has been marked by in-fighting between multiple factions and posturing","1818":"The Conservatives are mutilating themselves from within \u2014 moderate centrists and traditional conservatives in a seemingly life-and-death battle with extreme right-wingers who want to shred Britain\u2019s international legal obligations, like the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which the Conservative leader Winston Churchill helped draft, and who are never shy about being Islamophobic or to protest against \u201cwokeness\u201d, whatever that means at any given time","1819":"The public, weighed down by a cost-of-living crisis and crumbling public services \u2014 including Britain\u2019s world-renowned National Health Service \u2014 appear to have had enough","1820":"An important recent survey of more than 15,000 people by Survation forecasts that Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour will win a vast 286-seat majority at the general election later this year \u2014 with the Conservatives reduced to an embarrassing 80 seats","1821":"And yet it could have all been so different","1822":"When Sunak was appointed Minister of Finance in 2020, it inspired confidence in markets \u2014 despite the ongoing damage caused by Brexit","1823":"When Covid-19 hit, he quickly implemented sound policies, including the furlough scheme, which helped steer companies through the worst public health crisis in a century","1824":"Sunak enjoyed huge levels of popularity for aiding employees","1825":"His \u201cEat Out to Help Out\u201d scheme then helped prop up Britain\u2019s vitally important hospitality sector","1826":"But the economic aftermath of the pandemic \u2014 made worse by the additional cost of Brexit \u2014 has meant that Sunak\u2019s reputation for economic pragmatism has dissolved rapidly","1827":"He\u2019s also been fined for breaking Covid-19 rules; his cabinet ministers have been continually caught up in various scandals; and there have been defections and a coterie of MPs whose one solution to all life\u2019s problems is to bring back Boris Johnson","1828":"Being the fifth-worst prime minister in seven years and being forced to fix every problem your predecessors had to resign for, is no easy job","1829":"Making things worse is that he is robotic and has no feel for how ordinary people live their lives","1830":"He was widely mocked for not knowing how to pay for a can of Coke at a petrol station","1831":"He hasn\u2019t been able to stem leaks from Downing Street, which claim that he is just counting down the days until he loses the general election and can scarper off to California to take up some multi-million dollar gig as a Silicon Valley mandarin \u2014 while ordinary people struggle to pay their gas bills and nurses are forced to rely on food banks to feed themselves and their families","1832":"He lacks the political nous to get things done, instead relying on platitudes and statements written by recent political science graduates to deal with great matters of state \u2014 whether it\u2019s the cost of living crisis or the ECHR","1833":"The much-hailed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India has stalled and has barely crawled ahead under his leadership","1834":"The son of immigrant parents who lived the quintessential immigrant story \u2014 fleeing East Africa and establishing themselves and educating their children to the highest possible level \u2014 Sunak has repeatedly demonised immigrants, even publicly defending a major donor who made racist comments about migrants and Muslims","1835":"Curiously enough, apart from the asylum seekers who trickle in on small boats across the English Channel, the anti-immigrant rhetoric of his government has been felt most by the tens of thousands of South Asians and Africans who have arrived in the UK to fill the employment gaps left by the Europeans, who have fled the UK in their tens of thousands since the Brexit vote","1836":"The man who promised \u201cintegrity\u201d and \u201ctransparency\u201d has been found to have exercised anything but","1837":"The companies owned by his wife Akshata Murty \u2014 reportedly worth some 800 million pounds \u2014 are said to have saved many multiple millions by manipulating the tax system, while other companies have benefitted directly from government policies","1838":"Above all else, it is apparent that Sunak \u2014 the great hope for multicultural Britain \u2014 is unable to feel empathy","1839":"He can\u2019t imagine how it feels to be someone else \u2014 whether it\u2019s a nurse or an asylum seeker","1840":"There is no understanding of how to lose, to win, to feel

Mexico, southern Europe and South Africa on the evening of May 10, delighting skygazers and filling social media with images of exuberant pinks, greens and purples","1846":"But for those charged with protecting Earth from powerful solar storms such as the one that caused the auroras, a threat lurks beneath the stunning colours","1847":"\u201cWe need to understand that behind this beauty, there is danger,\u201d Quentin Verspieren, the European Space Agency\u2019s space safety programme coordinator, said","1848":"Mike Bettwy of the US Space Weather Prediction Centre said that \u201cwe\u2019re focused on the more sinister potential impacts\u201d of solar storms, such as taking out power grids and satellites, or exposing astronauts to dangerous levels of radiation","1849":"The latest auroras were caused by the most powerful geomagnetic storm since the \u201cHalloween Storms\u201d of October 2003, which sparked blackouts in Sweden and damaged power infrastructure in South Africa","1850":"There appears to have been less damage from the latest solar storms, though it often takes weeks for satellite companies to reveal problems, Bettwy said","1851":"There were reports that some self-driving farm tractors in the United States stopped in their tracks when their GPS guidance systems went out due to the storm, he said","1852":"\u2018Definitely not over\u2019These strange effects are caused by massive explosions on the surface of the Sun that shoot out plasma, radiation and even magnetic fields at incredibly fast speeds born on the solar wind","1853":"The recent activity has come from a sunspot cluster 17 times the size of Earth which has continued raging over the week","1854":"On Tuesday it blasted out the strongest solar flare seen in years","1855":"The sunspot has been turning towards the edge of the Sun\u2019s disc, so activity is expected to die down in the short term as its outbursts aim away from our planet","1856":"But in roughly two weeks the sunspot will swing back around, again turning its gaze towards Earth","1857":"In the meantime, another sunspot is  \u201ccoming into view right now\u201d which could trigger  \u201cmajor activity in the coming days\u201d, ESA space weather service coordinator Alexi Glover said","1858":"So the solar activity is  \u201cdefinitely not over\u201d, she added","1859":"It is difficult to predict how violent these sunspots could be \u2014 or whether they could spark further auroras","1860":"But solar activity is only just approaching the peak of its roughly 11-year cycle, so the odds of another major storm are highest  \u201cbetween now and the end of next year\u201d, Bettwy said","1861":"What threat do solar storms pose","1862":"Geomagnetic storms such as the recent one create a magnetic charge of voltage and current,  \u201cessentially overloading\u201d things like satellites and power grids, according to Bettwy","1863":"The most famous example came in 1859 during the worst solar storm in recorded history, called the Carrington Event","1864":"As well as stunning auroras, the storm caused sparks to fly off of telegraph stations","1865":"The charge that

concerns related to smuggling and security while minimising adverse effects on the daily lives of residents","2016":"\u201cIf Pakistan does not tackle this issue now, it will create a huge problem in

the smell because it\u2019s so achingly saccharine but this scent is just right \u2014 not too sweet","2030":"To be honest, this is not what I imagine the OG Chief Saab smells like","2031":"I don\u2019t know if the creator of the candle has a secret in or they were just guessing but I\u2019d imagine a slightly different scent \u2014\u00a0lighter on the oak and heavier on the jute with hints of betel nut","2032":"A little bit goes a long way with Chief Saab \u2014 you can burn it for a short while instead of keeping it burning for hours as we usually do and the scent will definitely remain","2033":"To test whether it was a universally appreciated candle, I took it around the Dawn","2034":"com office to ask some people what they thought","2035":"One editor who owns the candle herself said the scent took her by surprise, in a very good way","2036":"Another said it definitely smelt like a chief saab","2037":"Everyone really liked it","2038":"The candle is available on the Jugnu Candle website and at some stores","2039":"I bought mine at Object in Karachi","2040":"Jugnu says it creates \u201cretro-inspired, hand-poured scented candles that are uniquely Pakistani at

to start on May 27 after a religious group expressed its resentments over it","2174":"Dr Abdul Salam was a theoretical physicist and was the first Pakistani to win a Nobel Prize in 1979","2175":"The function was arranged to honour his services in the field of science","2176":"Abdus Salam Science Festival 2024 was being organised by Quaid-i-Azam University Science Society in collaboration of Pakistan Academy of Sciences and National Centre for Physics","2177":"The aim of the festival was to promote science, education and scientific thoughts","2178":"Participants from universities from across the country were to participate in various scientific modules, science model\/art exhibitions, panel discussions, study visits, astronomy night, musical concerts and competitions","2179":"Prof Pervez Hoodbhoy, Ramal Raja, Mohammad Adnan and other intellectuals and researchers had been invited to the festival","2180":"But, sources said that a religious group expressed its resentment with the university administration over the holding of the festival","2181":"There was also a lot of hue and cry on social media about it due to the scientist\u2019s faith, following which the administration postponed the event","2182":"A senior academician from the university said after a campaign was launched on social media, a delegation of the religious group met the QAU vice chancellor and managed to get the festival postponed","2183":"He said the vice chancellor informed all deans and organisers that the festival was being postponed, adding that, \u201cin Pakistan, postponed means canceled\u201d","2184":"The academician said the event had been held in 2022, but due to various issues, it was not held in 2023","2185":"\u201cIt was purely a science festival and had been arranged to make students understand science and its applications in future","2186":"It had nothing to do with any religious discussion,\u201d he added","2187":"The executive director of Abdus Salam Science

January of this year, I started teaching international criminal law at the Lahore University of Management Sciences to yawning law students who would turn up to my 8am class","2206":"I spent much of

it\u2019s not genocide","2208":"When asked whether I thought what Israel was doing was genocide, I replied \u2018probably not\u2019","2209":"This was based on the very high threshold set by the law and the International Court of Justice\u2019s past precedent","2210":"But a key fear was also that the ICJ would not hold that genocide had been committed, upholding this high threshold, and that everyone would treat this as an exoneration of Israel and a failure of international law, when it is neither","2211":"We have simply set the threshold for this crime that high in law","2212":"Between January and now though, my opinion has changed","2213":"The starving of civilians and refusal to allow aid trucks in, places this \u2014 to my mind \u2014 now squarely as one of the acts of genocide; that of deliberately inflicting upon the group conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction with the intent to destroy them","2214":"It seems that the ICJ may now also be leaning this way","2215":"South Africa has asked for new provisional measures twice since January and the ICJ granted the second one on March 28, ordering Israel to allow in relief supplies saying that famine was now no longer looming over Gaza, it was setting in","2216":"This is not as interesting though as the judge\u2019s separate opinions, seven of whom said the court should have asked for a ceasefire and that Israel would not be able to comply with its obligations under the Genocide Convention without halting military operations and letting in aid","2217":"The notion being that the

flashing red in Gaza","2220":"\u201dIn the coming days, the Court will listen to the case brought by Nicaragua against Germany for co-authoring Israel\u2019s genocide and war crimes","2221":"The largest supporter of Israel, the US, cannot be brought before the World Court because of reservations to its jurisdiction \u2014 nobody can try the US for genocide unless it has consented to being so tried","2222":"But Nicaragua may have picked Germany (over say, the UK, Canada or the Netherlands) because it has made Israel\u2019s security its very reason for existing","2223":"Angela Merkel famously said in 2007 that Israel\u2019s security is Germany\u2019s Staatsr\u00e4son, its reason for being a state","2224":"Outsourcing their guilt has resulted in Germany potentially being complicit in gross international crimes, the kind they ironically promised they would \u2018never again\u2019 commit","2225":"South Africa and Nicaragua are trying these countries perhaps because their current governments \u2014 the African National Congress and the Sandinistas \u2014 had strong links with the Palestinian liberation movement when they themselves were rebel movements","2226":"In both cases, the Israeli state supported the overthrown apartheid government in South Africa and the brutal Somozan dictatorship in Nicaragua","2227":"Liberation movements, it seems, remember well those who supported them and those who supported their oppressors and in an act of bureaucratic kindness for their comrades-in-arms, they have picked up the Palestinian cause in memory of this support","2228":"We don\u2019t know how the Court will decide either of these cases","2229":"What we do know though is that both the victim and the perpetrator of the Holocaust \u2014 the most well-known genocide in history \u2014 have been dragged before the ICJ for committing and supporting another one against the Palestinian people","2230":"And the countries taking them there are both from the Global South","2231":"Outside of the courtroom, the sands of power relations between states have shifted","2232":"The US has pushed China and Russia together, in what can only be explained as an act of hubris on the part of the superpower","2233":"It seems to believe it can take on both of them at once","2234":"Meanwhile, the rest of the world is aghast at the West\u2019s hypocrisy","2235":"Acclaimed author and editor Adam Shatz calls the West\u2019s janus-faced approach to the conflict compared to others \u2014 in which Russia\u2019s occupation of Ukraine is egregious, but the Israeli occupation of Palestine is fine \u2014 similar to \u201cthe fractures of 1956, when people in the \u2018developing world\u2019 sided with Algeria\u2019s struggle for self-determination, while Western countries backed Hungary\u2019s resistance to Soviet invasion\u201d","2236":"After October 7, the term Zionist has become a slur in the Global South in much the same way as \u2018jihadist\u2019 became one in the West post-9\/11","2237":"At the same time, the West continues to treat those shouting anti-semitism at the tiniest infraction akin to an oppressed minority group eligible for EU funding","2238":"Much of the world has accepted that Palestine is the most moral issue of our time for reasons wrapped up in ideology, religion, and morality","2239":"For the West, these are the old, false gods that they have forsworn for their new gods of individualism and capital","2240":"These new crusaders don\u2019t clutch the Bible, but liberalism","2241":"The East though remains wary of this new religion; it has seen what liberalism has mutated into in the West, with its alienation, empty consumerism, and dismantling of community, the export of which led to the invasion of Iraq","2242":"It also remains the reason for the West\u2019s continuing unflinching support in the face of genocide","2243":"Israel is after all the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, the villa in the jungle, a civilised nation among Muslim primitives","2244":"Israel plays on this as being the last bastion between Europe and savagery with Naftali Bennett, former Prime Minister of Israel, saying in 2015: \u201cIsrael is in the forefront of the global war on terror","2245":"This is the frontline between the free and civilised world and radical Islam","2246":"We\u2019re stopping the wave of radical Islam from flowing from Iran and Iraq all the way to Europe","2247":"When we fight terror here, we\u2019re protecting London, Paris and Madrid","2248":"\u201dIt\u2019s also why Hamas is the quintessential barbaric enemy; after all, they pledge fealty to the old gods in their demand for Palestinian statehood","2249":"Nationalism is perhaps one of the most powerful ideologies on the planet and Hamas is demanding a birth certificate for the nation-state of Palestine","2250":"It does so though through armed resistance, which, in both the intifadas and on October 7, has included the commission of war crimes against civilians","2251":"That is why the question of \u2018do you condemn Hamas","2252":"\u2019 so famously wielded by Piers Morgan for every pro-Palestinian on his show has become such a sticking point in the West","2253":"Those advocating for decolonisation seem to think that all violence is justified in the goal of liberation, whether that be against combatants or civilians","2254":"International law does allow us to have some consistency on this \u2014 people fighting for their right to self-determination have the right do so through all means necessary, including armed struggle","2255":"However, this right to resistance has to be exercised within the parameters of international law","2256":"That\u2019s why the first phase of Al-Aqsa floods on October 7 when Hamas targeted IDF soldiers and military targets was a legitimate act of resistance and hence, legal","2257":"But afterwards, when they went after grandmothers in the kibbutzim or rave-goers, it was not","2258":"But the demonisation of Hamas and its war crimes fulfils a much more insidious aim of denouncing the liberation group and its dogged resistance against the Israeli occupation as a whole","2259":"This is especially while the West trips over itself to designate them as a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d \u2014 a moniker long given to liberation movements to delegitimise them","2260":"The term \u2018terrorism\u2019 is a useless one","2261":"There is of yet no legal definition for this word owing to the international community\u2019s inability to decide when freedom fighting is terrorism and when it is not \u2014 though likely it remains in the outcome; whether they win or not","2262":"National liberation movements","2263":"when successful, are no longer terrorists","2264":"The ANC and the Sandinistas are examples of this; once they became the state, the label can no longer be applied","2265":"The notion that Hamas wants the destruction of Israel is also incorrect","2266":"The group pragmatically recognised the state of Israel in 2007 and the need for a Palestinian state to exist alongside an Israeli one","2267":"It is in line with Edward Said\u2019s foresight that both Palestinians and Jews have a right to live in that area and that they are condemned to live there together","2268":"Hamas fights then for an end to occupation, the right of return for Palestinians expelled from their homes, and the creation of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital","2269":"The commitment to armed resistance is also why Hamas is such a polarising movement among Palestinians","2270":"The group has watched closely the trajectory of the PLO, which then became the Palestinian Authority, and how it has become a \u201ccorrupt, toothless, quisling leadership subservient to the Israeli state\u201d","2271":"The PA, by most accounts, is now essentially a security sub-contractor for Israel, allowing it to inflict an essentially burden-free occupation in the West Bank; an occupation of Palestinians by Palestinians","2272":"And the PA, despite being allowed into the corridors of power, has not been able to get Palestinians any closer to having their own state","2273":"Its path to pacification has been littered with too many promises that have enriched its leaders but not the Palestinians it represents","2274":"Meanwhile, Hamas boasts that its armed resistance works","2275":"It forced the Israelis to disengage from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and is the only reason why the strip is not embroidered by Israeli settlements in the same way as the West Bank","2276":"This is also with limited support from the rest of the Muslim world; criticising the Arabs, a leader in Gaza said: \u201cHamas defends the Ummah\u2019s honour with self-made weapons while all the weapons piling up in the storage warehouses of the Arab armies are rusting, and if they\u2019re ever used, they\u2019re used against their own people","2277":"\u201d \n \nThe people of Gaza feel pride in the resistance","2278":"Researcher and author Tareq Baconi writes that \u201c[i]n countless conversations, I was reminded that while the Israeli army can drive up to any house in the West Bank and arrest its members \u2014 even to the house of the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas","2279":"\u2014 it was unable to step foot in Gaza","2280":"At least not without incurring a beating","2281":"This strip of land is thought of as undefiled, Palestinian, sterile of Israel\u2019s occupation","2282":"\u201dHamas claims that \u201cfighters\u2019 trenches not negotiators\u2019 hotels are what [will] resolve the conflict\u201d and while support for it may waver, given the extent to which Palestinians are punished in its name, it was strong in opinion polls taken right after the October 7 attacks","2283":"On the other hand, PA President Mahmoud Abbas is now \u2018extraordinarily unpopular\u2019 and 84 per cent of Palestinians want him to resign (going up to 93pc in the West Bank)","2284":"That\u2019s why it\u2019s unwise to say the Palestinian people are not represented by Hamas and, therefore, should not be collectively punished for their actions","2285":"Hamas may in fact represent the Palestinian people and they still should not be collectively punished for them","2286":"However, they have been and will continue to be","2287":"After Hamas was elected into power in 2007, an embargo was placed on the Gaza Strip, sanctions were imposed, and aid was frozen","2288":"This is the first time that such measures have ever been imposed on an occupied people as opposed to the occupier","2289":"The only way Hamas could ensure the survival of those placed under this blockade was by creating a honeycomb of tunnels beneath the strip to ensure that food and supplies could be smuggled in","2290":"Israel now drops 2,000 pound bombs to destroy these tunnels, killing the refugees camped above them","2291":"Golda Meir, Israel\u2019s first female prime minister, famously said: \u201cWe can forgive the Arabs for killing our children but we cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children","2292":"\u201d The gymnastics of logic in this response is shocking","2293":"The Palestinians have forced the Israelis to kill their children, to bury them in rubble, and to starve them to death","2294":"Six months on, nothing and yet everything has changed","2295":"Over 33,000 Palestinians have been slaughtered, 12,300 of whom are children, by the IDF and their algorithmically overdosed killing machines","2296":"The death toll on the Israeli side, amid this casino of execution, is over 1,400 \u2014 including almost 1,200 killed on Oct 7 and another 251 since","2297":"Both the perpetrator and victim of the Holocaust are on trial for collaborating to commit a genocide against the Palestinians","2298":"Meanwhile, the Palestinian struggle for self-determination, for their right to return, for their right to resist, is now overshadowed by their need to simply survive","2299":"They are being starved to death by the only liberal democracy in the Middle East","2300":"At the start of Tareq Baconi\u2019s seminally important book, Hamas Contained, he recounts an uncomfortable conversation which I want to reproduce in full:\u201cMy fixer in Gaza told me a story","2301":"There was once a village whose men were all drafted to fight in some faraway battle","2302":"While the men were gone, enemy soldiers invaded the village and raped all the women who had been left behind, and went on their way","2303":"The women, shell-shocked and bloodied, mourned their fate as they congregated to comfort one another in the village square","2304":"One woman was missing","2305":"They went looking for her and found her lying under the soldier who had tried to rape her","2306":"With her own hands, she had managed to kill him and save herself from the lot of her fellow villagers","2307":"Joy at her safety soon soured","2308":"The raped women now worried they would be judged by their husbands for not similarly fighting for their honour and fending off their rapists","2309":"In no time, this undefiled survivor became a symbol of their shame","2310":"Swiftly, they conspired to kill her","2311":"The storyteller turned to me and said, that woman, the survivor, is Gaza","2312":"She has refused to submit to Israel\u2019s occupation and its rape and pillage of Palestinian land while other Palestinian and Arab leaders have succumbed","2313":"She has become a source of pride for Gazans who maintain their armed resistance against Israel","2314":"She is now a shameful reminder for those who have accepted their fate","2315":"Arabs and Palestinians elsewhere have looked away as she is bombarded, incessantly and mercilessly","2316":"Israel has focused all its efforts on shaming and breaking it","2317":"For she remains the only proud bit of Palestine that refuses to yield","2318":"\u201cIf there is a chink of light that can be offered, my hope rests not with the institutions created in the wake of the horrors of a World War, but with the desire for liberation","2319":"If international law must fail, let nationalism win","2320":"May we see a Palestinian state within our lifetime","2321":"Header image: Palestinians inspect the

criticism","2451":"Much more detailed than the Defamation Ordinance, 2002, it will replace, the new Punjab Defamation Bill, 2024 goes even further than the dictatorship-era regulations laid out in the

launching cross-border strikes in response to terror attacks on India","2574":"He has also ridiculed Pakistan by saying \u201ca supplier of terrorism is now struggling for flour\u201d","2575":"This makes the outlook for Pakistan-India relations a troubled one if Modi returns to power","2576":"Some may dismiss Modi\u2019s Pakistan-bashing as election politics, but words have

(Napa) featured presentations (on Sunday) as part of the academy\u2019s ongoing first Women\u2019s Performing Arts Festival","3004":"Directed by Aliya Abbasi and produced by Lahore\u2019s Azad Theatre, Akhiyan was staged with noteworthy artistic zeal","3005":"The story revolves around an orphan young girl called Begum (played by Aliya Abbasi herself) who cannot see","3006":"This disability is compounded by the fact that she has been forced to marry someone she does not love","3007":"Her uncle is her caretaker who has brought up her with affection","3008":"When the plot begins to unfold, in a scene which does not have Begum, the protagonist\u2019s predicament comes to light clearly","3009":"The audience soon realises, as Begum interacts with another girl in her first appearance on stage in the second scene, that she is not a meek character","3010":"She also carries a knife which is a symbol of her intrepid being","3011":"She is not afraid of speaking her mind","3012":"Director Aliya Abbasi also performs lead role in the show staged in connection with Women\u2019s Performing Arts FestivalAkhiyan signifies the importance of how the will of a person can take on society and its unpalatable norms","3013":"If one\u2019s memory serves right, then the play was performed at Napa in 2015, and was well received","3014":"The production on Sunday evening had its merits, too, the foremost of which was the hard work that the actors had put in","3015":"The live music was good","3016":"However, one felt that the tabla rolls during the scenes were a bit jarring","3017":"And one more thing: it was nice to hear Shiv Kumar Batalvi\u2019s poem Ik kudi as the soundtrack for the play \u2014 the poem had become quite popular when it was used in the Indian film Udta Punjab (2016) with a different composition","3018":"Also on Sunday, a befitting tribute to pop icon Nazia Hasan was paid during the 11th day of the Napa\u2019s festival","3019":"The tribute began with a documentary showcasing Nazia\u2019s work from her childhood days to her rise and till untimely death","3020":"Later, in a concert, Seerat Jafri sang some of Nazia\u2019s all-time hits","3021":"Seerat also presented some Jazz hits from renowned female singers of the genre","3022":"Another documentary, Dancing the Female Body in Pakistan, made by Kathak dancer Nighat Chaudhry was also screened at the event","3023":"Originally published in Dawn, May 7th, 2024","3024":"Silent discos started back in the 1970s as a convenient way to get around noise restrictions","3025":"In those days, that meant everyone bringing their own music loaded on to a Walkman","3026":"Later, DJs would set up their own radio channels to allow everyone to listen to the same playlist","3027":"These events gained popularity in the early 2000s, when music festivals began to host silent gigs, with lots of artists streaming on different channels","3028":"At a regular disco or nightclub, everybody experiences dancing together in time to the same music","3029":"But at a silent disco, people can be dancing in the same space but out of time with each other, if they\u2019re listening to different music across several channels","3030":"This can be a strange experience, but it does provide a very useful context to study the importance of synchrony \u2014 more commonly known as being \u201cin sync\u201d on the dance floor","3031":"Here\u2019s why listening to music and dancing in sync brings us closer togetherSo what does the \u201csilent disco\u201d phenomenon tell us about dance","3032":"Researchers have used it to study social dynamics, finding that it interferes with the social bonding effects of dance","3033":"Silent disco may even help us to better understand the evolution of musicality and our rhythmic abilities","3034":"As a cognitive anthropologist, my work looks at why humans spend so much time singing and dancing, and I am particularly interested in how dance \u201cworks\u201d as a social activity","3035":"Silent disco in the labIn a recent study using a silent disco experiment, I wanted to find out how important it was for dancers to be in sync","3036":"Since people were dancing with headphones on, we could use this to control whether they were listening to the same music or not","3037":"This allowed us to separate the effects of sharing a dance floor from the experience of dancing in sync","3038":"In our study, we had pairs of participants listening to the same music, but we manipulated whether the music was in time by adding some delay to one of the channels","3039":"Even though they didn\u2019t know that we were manipulating the timing, we found that people preferred it when they heard the music in time with their dance partner","3040":"They also looked towards each other more when they were listening in sync","3041":"This silent disco method has also been used in similar studies, in which researchers found that we remember people better if we\u2019ve just been dancing in sync with them, and synchronised dancing may also stimulate the endorphin system, which creates positive feelings","3042":"Being togetherPeople seem to like each other more when moving in sync","3043":"This is true in more naturalistic silent disco studies, but also in very basic experiments that just involve synchronised finger tapping","3044":"The synchronisation involved in music and dance may be the \u201cactive ingredient\u201d in their social bonding effects","3045":"Singing and dancing with others is a great way of fostering synchrony, but it also exists in many kinds of social interactions","3046":"Anyone who experienced Zoom fatigue during the pandemic may have actually been suffering from the slight temporal delay that interrupts the flow of conversation and prevents being in sync, which can get pretty frustrating and ultimately exhausting in a Zoom setting","3047":"While live concerts were being replaced with live-streams during the Covid pandemic, some of my colleagues even observed that live-streams fostered a greater feeling of social connection when compared with pre-recorded concerts, partly because of the synchrony involved","3048":"There\u2019s something special about knowing that someone is sharing an experience with us in time, even if we are separated by distance","3049":"Evolution of musicSome researchers have suggested that the social bonding effects of music and dance may have been important for the evolution of musicality","3050":"They propose that synchronising with others helps to reduce stress by releasing \u201cfeel good\u201d endorphins","3051":"Reducing stress for other people makes them like you more, which may elevate your social status, or even improve your chance of finding a mate \u2014 so people with better musical abilities could be more successful in evolution terms","3052":"An alternative theory suggests that group synchronisation may be a way of displaying the strength of the group to others, such as a marching band in a military parade","3053":"These two apparently competing theories could actually be complementary \u2014 although it is very difficult to test this scientifically, because obviously we can\u2019t replicate all of human evolution in the lab, so these debates may never truly be solved","3054":"One thing that is certain is that music and dance have important social functions in society today","3055":"When many people around the world appear to be suffering from loneliness, it is important to understand how people create and maintain social bonds","3056":"It may be that group song and dance was the method of choice for our ancestors, as it still is for many people today around the world","3057":"However, if you do plan on making friends on the dance floor, it might be best to ditch the headphones","3058":"The writer is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford in the UKRepublished from The ConversationPublished in Dawn,

attractive destination to live and put down some roots in","3069":"At the same time, however, the emirate seems to have become a haven for those looking to hide their wealth \u2014 whether lawfully or

fact","3075":"Many individuals who have been part of present or past governments, individuals known to be associated with them, as well as several military generals were found to be in ownership of properties worth millions in Dubai \u2014 a revelation that is unlikely to sit well with the struggling masses, who generally view power with suspicion","3076":"In a country where mega-corruption scandals are all too familiar, questions will follow","3077":"Of course, many of the properties owned by Pakistanis may have been acquired lawfully, and the state must not harass ordinary citizens about where they want to spend their money","3078":"At the same time, the authorities have a responsibility to approach the C4ADS and OCCRP, which are in possession of the Dubai data, and ask for it to be shared so that they may determine if any criminals, politically exposed or sanctioned persons are on the Dubai property register","3079":"The FBR chairman has told Dawn that the authority will,

Quetta","3231":"In his address, Mr Bugti decried the rhetoric about Balochistan where its people \u201cwho are already at the receiving end\u201d were blamed for problems instead of the state, which was responsible for providing facilities like health and education to its citizens","3232":"He also spoke extensively on the pessimism among Balocshitan\u2019s young population, saying that the youth were disappointed with the government","3233":"\u201cOur youth is wandering aimlessly with degrees [but] jobs are being sold,\u201d the CM claimed, and vowed that this won\u2019t happen in his tenure

Mousavi\u2019s paintings \u2014 on display at the exhibition titled \u2018Zamistan\u2019, curated by Aasim Akhtar at Chawkandi Art Gallery, Karachi \u2014 appear like pearls sequestered inside an oyster, waiting to be retrieved","3238":"Mousavi\u2019s minimalist approach, linear markings, usage of the Persian script, and a restrained application of gold leaf and abstract forms evoke a sense of both delicate and subtle beauty","3239":"The imagery, however, can be read on many levels","3240":"Mousavi\u2019s is a world of metaphors, challenging the viewer to meander into uncertainty and wonder","3241":"Quetta-born Mousavi\u2019s art is anchored in Persian literary traditions and, despite the lack of familiarity or interest regarding this discourse amongst the Pakistani masses, he continues to produce the most remarkable critique of our times","3242":"The title of the show, \u2018Zamistan\u2019, is inspired by the works of the Iranian poet Mehdi Akhavan-Sales","3243":"Zamistan, meaning winter, is used as a metaphor for our times","3244":"It suggests a frozen condition of the mind and body, where people are unable to unfold their arms to greet each other, nor are they willing to give a positive response","3245":"This is made evident even in the names of his paintings, such as in The Weather is Cold\u2026Poetry, calligraphy and spirituality intertwine in Fazil Hussain Mousavi\u2019s artworkTo understand Mousavi\u2019s art is to hear him draw parallels to the verses of Rumi, Hafiz Shirazi, Abdul Qadir Bedil and other poets","3246":"His art and imagery is steeped in the knowledge of Firdousi\u2019s Shahnameh [The Book of Kings] and is a natural outcome of his familiarity with literature","3247":"When he was in the sixth grade, his father, a religious scholar, introduced Mousavi to Shirazi\u2019s works","3248":"His father would also make him recite a ghazal by Hafiz every night with \u2018\u2019impeccable pronunciation\u201d and then make him memorise a new one","3249":"The White Demon or Dev (the master sorcerer) and Rustom, the great warrior (The Shield of Persia), from the Shahnameh appear from time to time in Mousavi\u2019s imagery","3250":"Mousavi\u2019s approach, however, is so minimalistic and poetic \u2014 particularly apparent in the Following the Form series \u2014 that one imagines him holding his breath for every mark that he makes","3251":"He internalises the collective consciousness of centuries by relocating historical literary sources into a new critique of his times","3252":"This is the integrity and beauty on the periphery in Pakistani art","3253":"Interestingly, Mousavi\u2019s father\u2019s will was inscribed in the calligraphic style known as Khat-i-Mirzai (Persian-Arabic script), whose aesthetic beauty appealed to Mousavi and subconsciously entered his art","3254":"Furthermore, the ribcage is a recurring image in Mousavi\u2019s paintings, serving as a reminder of the separation between the body and soul, thus showcasing the entrapment of the soul","3255":"Mousavi makes his artistic position clear: \u201cWhenever I am asked about my art, it leaves me wondering about what I really paint","3256":"I am confronted by many doubts","3257":"What is the source of all this","3258":"\u201d He believes that an artist makes visible whatever is unseen around us","3259":"He questions whether, while hundreds of portraits of Abdul Sattar Edhi have been painted, any artist has tried to capture Edhi\u2019s \u2018khuloos\u2019 [sincerity]","3260":"True to the countenance of a visionary himself, Mousavi\u2019s conversation drifts into the poetry of Rumi, debating on the reality of man\u2019s existence","3261":"He quotes Rumi, saying that even a mosquito can affect a person\u2019s physical being, the \u2018zahir\u2019","3262":"But the essence, or the \u2018baatin\u2019, is larger than the seven skies","3263":"Similarly, when you extract the essence from the physical reality, you begin the journey of knowledge","3264":"According to Mousavi, that is where art begins","3265":"\u2018Zamistan\u2019 was on display at Chawkandi Art Gallery in Karachi from April 20-30, 2024The

May 19th, 2024","3317":"Pakistan\u2019s external economy is plagued primarily with two structural problems","3318":"First, a high level of public external debt and second, overreliance on further external borrowings that not only increase the external debt stocks but also push the future cost of debt servicing","3319":"All other issues are ramifications of these two conundrums","3320":"Our fragile and malleable democracy makes it too difficult for politicians to take the nation on board and find sustainable solutions to these problems of the external economy","3321":"A focus on short-term solutions prevail, and the government of the day, with varying levels of support from the military establishment, try to fix the balance of payments problems, often with the help of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and friendly countries","3322":"The role of the IMF has always remained a subject of intense debate revolving around the desirability for and efficacy of its prescriptions for the ailing economy","3323":"According to the State Bank of Pakistan, our public external debt and total external debt stood at $99","3324":"7 billion and $131","3325":"6bn, respectively, at the end of December last year","3326":"The irony is that the IMF continues to prescribe reforms that provide temporary relief from the balance of payments problems, but do not enable Pakistan to ensure sustainable cuts in external debts in the medium to long term","3327":"The Fund\u2019s programmes also do not put Pakistan\u2019s economy on a high-growth trajectory for the medium to long term","3328":"Focusing on IMF-enabled short-term respite remains top-priority instead of long-term, sustainable solutionsThis, coupled with all kinds of weaknesses in our political\/judicial systems, including the intervention of \u2018the establishment\u2019 has been hampering sustainable, strong economic growth for many years","3329":"In the absence of this growth, our reliance on external borrowing remains intact and the IMF\u2019s requirements take centre stage in economic policymaking","3330":"Keeping this in mind, it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise for most Pakistanis that the IMF now wants to peruse Pakistan\u2019s budget strategy before its approval from the federal cabinet","3331":"This was inevitable and, according to credible media reports, the inevitable has happened now","3332":"During this fiscal year, ending on June 30, Pakistan has apparently overcome the balance of payments crisis thanks to a $3bn IMF loan augmented by crucial rollovers of previous loans of Saudi Arabia and China","3333":"For the next fiscal year, the IMF\u2019s initial projection of the external financing gap is $22bn","3334":"Closing this gap isn\u2019t easy if Pakistan doesn\u2019t remain under the IMF\u2019s umbrella reforms programme","3335":"Exactly why the country is desperately seeking $6bn-$8bn IMF funding for three years, and that\u2019s why the government\u2019s priority is to maintain a good relationship with the Fund","3336":"If that means discussing the budget strategy with the IMF, so be it","3337":"Pakistan has four major demands on its foreign exchange: Imports, external debt servicing, repatriation of profits and dividends earned by foreign companies and foreign investors in Pakistan \u2014 and financing of foreign education, health and travel expenses of Pakistanis","3338":"The country also has four major sources of forex inflows, ie exports, remittances, foreign direct and portfolio investments, and funding from international financial institutions and friendly countries","3339":"Being under the umbrella of the Fund programme signals to global investors the perceived safety of their capitalBeing under the umbrella of the IMF programme signals to global investors the perceived safety of their capital and helps us attract foreign investment and even state funding from friendly countries","3340":"It also helps our exporters reach out to foreign markets with relative ease","3341":"So, securing IMF funding as soon as possible is a must, and that\u2019s what the government is trying to do","3342":"But exports and remittances, being non-debt creating forex inflows, have primacy and that too is being respected","3343":"The problem, however, is that with back-breaking cost-push inflation still above 17pc the corporate sector finds it too hard to boost exports of goods within a year or two","3344":"But taking services exports, particularly information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITeS) exports, to higher levels rapidly is possible","3345":"That is where Pakistani policymakers should continue doubling up their present efforts","3346":"Similarly, tapping the full potential of remittances is important","3347":"On both fronts, the government is making some efforts but those are too small to make a big change in near future","3348":"So far, the situation is less promising and outright is bleak","3349":"During nine months of this fiscal year (July 2023 to March 2024), exports of services fetched $5","3350":"8bn \u2014 showing a year-on-year increase of less than 1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics","3351":"During the same period, imports of services consumed $7","3352":"5bn, leaving a services trade deficit of $1","3353":"7bn","3354":"Experience has shown time and again boosting services exports without allowing enough rise in imports is just not possible, at least for the time being","3355":"A drastic policy overhaul is in order","3356":"During these nine months, remittances also grew from less than 1pc to $21bn, according to the State Bank of Pakistan","3357":"On the other hand, Pakistan\u2019s goods trade deficit during 10 months (July 2023-April 2024) totalled $19","3358":"5bn despite all import restrictions, many of which may go after the IMF offers a new loan","3359":"Then, the goods trade deficit would be equal to remittances, leaving the services trade deficit to be financed from borrowed foreign funds","3360":"Pakistan can avoid this situation by promoting services exports, particularly IT and ITeS exports if it collaborates meaningfully with global IT giants like Google with the stated objective that IT and ITeS exports\u2019 growth must overtake imports growth within a year or so","3361":"It can also address the issue of goods export growth with the IMF with a clear request presented with enough rationale that the Fund should let Pakistan\u2019s import curbs continue for some time","3362":"The task is easier said than done, but optimism and grit often make miracles","3363":"Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, May 13th, 2024","3364":"WITH the mercury

logo","3444":"Is this the beginning of a new empire in Karachi\u2019s food scene","3445":"Only time will tell","3446":" I wish to begin this piece with the lines that Hasan Zaidi quoted to end his essay on Paul Auster in Books and Authors last Sunday (May 12): \u201cMan has not one and the same life","3447":"He has many lives, placed end to end, and that is the cause of his misery","3448":"\u201d These are words from early 19th century French memoirist Chateaubriand, translated into English by Auster, which appear as an epigraph at the beginning of the novel The Book of Illusions","3449":"Chateaubriand\u2019s words somehow reminded me of the leading Romantic poet Lord Byron\u2019s famous saying: \u201cI doubt sometimes that a quiet and unagitated life would have suited me \u2014 yet I sometimes long for it","3450":"\u201d   A quiet and unagitated life would mean living a simple, straightforward life that may eventually keep one without misery and at peace","3451":"That may well be possible to an extent for monks, nuns, ascetics and fakirs","3452":"But next to impossible for painters, poets, writers and performing artists","3453":"They cannot help the constant suffering caused by an inner angst while, at the same time, they get drawn towards what is called in Arabic taktheer (pronounced takseer in Urdu) \u2014 the variety, the plurality and the choice that the world offers to their beings","3454":"It is not only their desire to seek pleasure and their inner angst that continue to negotiate and clash with each other, it is the political world around them that compounds their misery","3455":"The Czech-French writer Milan Kundera defined himself once as a hedonist trapped in a world politicised to extremes","3456":"I would say that it is three powers that continue to pull creative people in three different directions with full force: the inner sadness that they cannot escape, the nonconformity that their desires and yearnings bring, and the conformity that politics and society demand from them","3457":"Pulled in three different directions, they are left torn and tormented","3458":"This makes painters, poets, writers and performing artists prone to psychological issues and mental health challenges, some conditions leading them to commit suicide \u2014 examples range from geniuses such as Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf, to our own brilliant poets Shakeb Jalali and Sarwat Hussain","3459":"Three powers continue to pull creative people in three different directions with full force: the inner sadness that they

talent]","3461":"\u201dMir also went through a long episode of mental illness","3462":"Much after Mir, poet Munir Niazi wrote: \u201cChaahta hoon main Munir iss umr ke anjaam par\/ Aik aisi zindagi jo iss qadar mushkil na ho [Munir, I wish that when my life ends\/ I get a life which is not as difficult as the present one]","3463":"\u201d If we take a look at the great painters, from Vincent Van Gogh to Edvard Munch to Georgia O\u2019Keefe, you will find many who have struggled with mental health issues","3464":"Even Michelangelo is said to have suffered from bouts of depression and anxiety and wouldn\u2019t eat or change his clothes for days","3465":"Some of these great artists\u2019 work is attributed to their mental health conditions and psychological make-ups","3466":"In my view, there was an inner fire that consumed them, but there was also heat from the fire outside","3467":"A lot has been explored and written about the relationships between genius and madness, and creativity and anxiety","3468":"From Kay Redfield Jamison and Ann Belford Ulanov to Jay Macnaughton and Shamim Ahmed, there is a lot of literature made available to us by scholars ranging from literary critics to psychologists","3469":"But is there a final word on the issue","3470":"Perhaps, it is true that artists are more prone to such conditions and their numbers are higher among those who suffer from mental or psychological illness, but there are many others who are able to prevail upon their demons","3471":"I must confess that, after having experienced even milder forms of such problems and then seeing people from up close who have gone through mental health challenges, I do not want to romanticise mental health problems by claiming that they come with artistic talent","3472":"One understands that many supposedly normal people are fascinated by abnormalities and freakishness if they are found in artists or performers they look at from a distance","3473":"But it is not wise for any society to turn its creative people into freaks and then tell us that it is an occupational hazard","3474":"The society and polity of the country need to lessen the pain of creative minds","3475":"And not just creative minds, everyone","3476":"Compassion and forgiveness can turn the world into a better place for all","3477":"This reminds me of our leading poet, Fahmida Riaz, whose life was made miserable from time to time by our society and the state","3478":"Later in life, after losing her only son, she suffered from acute anxiety and depression","3479":"She channelised those emotions in her work and braved the tumultuous times like few have","3480":"Artists, poets, writers and performers may also try to overpower their anxiety and pain with their creative talent and intellectual determination, like Riaz did","3481":"It does seem like a tall order for all, but may also be read as an autosuggestion to myself","3482":"The writer is a poet and

military campaign in Gaza, which has so far killed over 35,000 Palestinians, including nearly 14,000 children over the past seven months in revenge for the Hamas assault on Oct 7 last year, has exposed the objectivity and impartiality claims of many leading Western newspapers and media outlets","3486":"The New York Times, whose coverage of the Oct 7 events and its aftermath won the 2024 Pulitzer for international coverage, has been disappointing in so many ways","3487":"Analysts have for months strung together its headlines that refrained from naming Israel for the mass killings in Gaza","3488":"A couple of its stories have come in for considerable stick after readers and small independent digital media platforms investigated not just the claims contained in them but also who was responsible for the newsgathering, ie, whose byline appeared on these","3489":"The foremost example of such reporting was a front-page story on Dec 31, 2023, which detailed the alleged rape of many Israeli women by the Oct 7 attackers","3490":"There was scepticism within the Times newsroom and its print story, which was also to be made into a podcast, never made it into audio","3491":"Most Western media will have you believe the Palestine issue cropped up on Oct 7, and not with the Nakba","3492":"One of the murdered women\u2019s families, which was cited as a source by the Times reporters, later said they did not believe she was raped, and neither did the reporters mention rape when interviewing them","3493":"About a third of the story was centred on this particular victim","3494":"(Watch the investigation by \u2018Breaking Points\u2019 journalists online","3495":")After The Intercept reported on the serious differences of opinion in the NYT newsroom over the editorial decisions on the rape story, the union representing 1,500 NYT newsroom staff, made a representation to the management decrying the \u2018interrogation\u2019 of staff of Middle Eastern origin on suspicion of leaking the story","3496":"When asked at a public forum about his evidence, Jeffery Gettleman, whose byline appeared alongside two other reporters, said he was uncomfortable with the term \u2018evidence\u2019 as it applied to courts and that the journalist\u2019s job is to \u2018present information\u2019","3497":"I would have added \u2018credible information\u2019","3498":"It emerged later that an Israeli, Anat Schwartz, who shared the byline with Gettleman, had \u2018liked\u2019 posts that were vehemently anti-Palestinian (she later took down her social media accounts)","3499":"It also emerged she served in the Israeli Defence Forces and was in the Air Intelligence, possibly a Hasbara specialist","3500":"Another story appeared this March about the \u2018food convoy stampede\u2019 in late February, which killed around 100 starving Palestinians and left another 700 wounded as they tried to reach the trucks","3501":"The Israeli version was taken as fact by the NYT journalist reporting on the event","3502":"Multiple sources and media outlets reported that the IDF opened automatic fire on the Palestinians, and the IDF itself vaguely acknowledged this fact while blaming the victims for it","3503":"Yasemin Giritli nceolu, a visiting professor of media studies at the LSE Media and Communication Department, says there is nothing new in this pro-Israel bias in the Western media","3504":"Writing in The Wire, she quoted a 2011 study by the Glasgow Media Group on the BBC\u2019s news broadcasts, which documented the differences in language used for Israelis and Palestinians","3505":"Google her piece for many such examples where NYT and Washington Post headlines displayed a brazen tilt, and even the BBC World\/News handle on X used \u2018dead\u2019 for those killed in Gaza and \u2018killed\u2019 for Israelis","3506":"Most Western media will have you believe the Palestine issue cropped up on Oct 7, 2023 and not with the

Israel on Oct","3508":"7, killing around 1,200 people and taking an additional 250 hostage","3509":"Palestinian militants still hold about 100 captives, and Israel\u2019s military has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants","3510":"\u201dIronically, AP itself does not make the same distinction, as it does not mention that the 1,200 Israelis killed on Oct 7 included some 400 security personnel","3511":"By contrast, Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper incurred the wrath of its own government when the cabinet considered banning it on national security grounds because it carried (and continues to carry) several pieces criticising Netanyahu\u2019s Gaza policy and printed graphic accounts of killings and destruction in the Strip","3512":"All Israeli TV channels censor Gaza stories and footage","3513":"A Haaretz story based on released Palestinian prisoner testimonies about widespread sexual abuse and torture got little to no traction in the Western media","3514":"Most of the US and UK media are either blindly sympathetic to Israel or petrified of it to do the kind of journalism they should be doing","3515":"I am aware only of British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan being dropped by his channel in the US","3516":"However, there are several cases in the UK where

work","3520":"Matthew Chance\u2019s story, based on whistle-blowers\u2019 accounts of Palestinian detainees\u2019 sub-human treatment and torture at a military-run camp, made headlines","3521":"CNN\u2019s Jomana Karadsheh reported not just on the 14,000 children killed but also on the heart-breaking plight of the 20,000 WCNSF (wounded child, no surviving family), many of whom are amputees","3522":"Israel may have banned Al Jazeera recently for its bold, powerful reporting, but the widespread use of social media bringing to our smartphones horrific images of the Gaza

long way to go","3525":"Palestin\u00adians have been dehumanised so systematically and for so long that they have indeed become children of a lesser God","3526":"Journalists around the world react

commercial flights, special flights have been arranged","3580":"Through these 540 more students will be able to return and the [total] number will increase to 670","3581":"\u201dHe further said that the government had also talked to the air force today, adding that it would also operate a special flight","3582":"\u201cThe capacity of that flight will be approximately 130 and for that the embassy has let the students know [\u2026] So far, around 50 students have let the embassy know they wish to go on this flight,\u201d he said","3583":"The development comes after around more than 100 students

planned","3591":"Addressing the media today, Dar quoted Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Zheenbek Kulubaev as telling him that a total of 16 foreign students had been injured, including four to five

satisfy our students [\u2026] so this is why we accepted their request,\u201d the deputy premier said","3600":"Recalling that he had sent two additional officers from the FO to assist the Pakistani mission, Dar said if needed, the additional secretary of the foreign ministry could also be sent after discussing the matter with PM Shehbaz","3601":"It was decided that both countries would monitor the situation daily at a high-level multiple times a day, Dar stated, reiterating that the Kyrgyz FM had told him that no Pakistani student had died","3602":"\u201cIf students want to leave, we are prepared to bring them back [\u2026]  but obviously not all students would like to come,\u201d the deputy premier asserted","3603":"Tarar emphasised that Pakistani students were not the target of the clashes as they had taken place between local students and those of an Arab country","3604":"\u201cClashes were not targeted against Pakistan or Pakistani students but when such a situation arises,

money","3621":"The Kashmir affairs minister reiterated that those students who wanted to return could inform the embassy there and would be brought back","3622":"Asked about the total number of Pakistani students in Kyrgyzstan, Dar said there were 11,000 enrolled in Bishkek while another 6,000 in other cities, highlighting that they all were in different institutions whereas the current violence at medical students\u2019 dorms was at a separate location from those","3623":"Further explaining the cancellation of his visit, Dar said Kyrgyzstan was a brotherly Muslim country, had assured Pakistan that the situation was under control and the government there supported international students","3624":"\u201cIf need be, we definitely will go there","3625":"We are monitoring

ongoing power shortages","4093":"The question remains: is this a genuine threat or simply a political ploy","4094":"Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur stated in the provincial legislature that the federal government and its relevant ministries have cut provincial receipts by Rs300 billion this fiscal year","4095":"Previously, similar requests for unpaid funds, particularly for merging tribal districts, were made under the province\u2019s caretaker government tenure","4096":"However, the situation remains unresolved","4097":"The federal government has approved a Rs23bn package for AJK in response to protests","4098":"This move is expected to strengthen KP\u2019s position in securing its fair share","4099":"The question now is whether the KP government will seek its share from the

will meet its obligation to display a surplus of Rs96bn as agreed with the International Monetary Fund","4102":"Contrary to this, it is still being determined whether the province is complaining about a decline in federal government resources transfer while demonstrating a surplus to meet IMF terms, implying that the provincial development budget will bear the brunt of the surplus","4103":"In background interviews and discussions with high-ranking officials of the KP government, it has come to the forefront that a staggering 95 per cent of all the revenue receipts of the provincial government are reliant on the federal government","4104":"This dependency on the federal government has significant implications for the financial stability and autonomy of the provincial administration","4105":"Any decline in these disbursements disrupts the intricate equilibrium of the KP government, jeopardising the timely payment of salaries and pensions","4106":"After the 25th

owned 14","4110":"62pc and Fata 5","4111":"02pc","4112":"The major parties ignored this infringement, but the KP caretaker regime and now the PTI government raised it with the federal government","4113":"The provincial government spent Rs116bn on the current and development budgets of the amalgamated districts in FY24, receiving only Rs66bn from the centre and leaving a balance of Rs50bn","4114":"Mr Amin has given the federal government a two-month deadline to transfer the remaining tribal regions amount to the province or face resistance","4115":"Since February 2022, there has been zero sales tax on petroleum products, significantly reducing provinces\u2019 revenue share","4116":"However, the federal government collects petroleum development levy (PDL) with a target of Rs1 trillion for FY24","4117":"If POL products were subject to sales tax, provinces would have received half of the revenue","4118":"This decision has a significant impact on KP and Balochistan because Sindh and Punjab get a lot of revenue from general sales tax (GST) on services","4119":"The KP finance department has identified Rs8bn as a pending NFC difference sum","4120":"The province has also questioned the authenticity of the FBR\u2019s revenue-collecting figures for June 2023","4121":"Interestingly, the finance department\u2019s letter also wants accurate monthly FBR collection data for efficient budgetary planning","4122":"At the same time, the federal government is hesitant to resolve the cross-input tax adjustment between the KP Revenue Authority and the FBR","4123":"This amount is anticipated to be Rs5","4124":"33bn for the five years between 2016 and 2020, and it is seeking federal approval","4125":"Another significant problem for the province is the transfer of the windfall oil levy (WLO) to the province","4126":"The oil fields in KP produce over 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day, accounting for around 42pc of total national production","4127":"The KP caretaker government has also raised this matter with the then-Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Caretaker Prime Minister Anwarul Haq Kakar on various occasions","4128":"However, the matter is still unresolved","4129":"The PTI government has again raised the issue with the current federal government, requesting an early release of the province\u2019s delayed WLO money","4130":"The provincial administration estimates that the omission will result in financial losses of Rs50bn for the Tal Block and Rs511 million for the oil-producing fields of Baratai and Togh","4131":"Published in Dawn,

Israel\u2019s genocidal war in Gaza broke out across US campuses, a friend suggested that they were perhaps similar to the anti-Vietnam War protests of the 1960s","4211":"I disagreed, simply because, at the end of the day, US forces are not directly involved in the fighting in Palestine and American kids are not being conscripted to go fight in the war and are not coming back in bodybags, so the emotional investment is entirely different","4212":"But the discussion did take me back to the anti-South African apartheid and pro-divestment protests on American campuses in the 1980s, of which I was also once a part","4213":"I suggested that the current protests bore more similarity to that movement which, it should be recalled, did indeed achieve its aims eventually","4214":"It would be instructive to look at exactly what happened more than 30 years ago","4215":"I arrived at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire in the fall of 1987 to study for my undergraduate degree","4216":"A year and a half earlier, an incident had taken place at the college that had been seared into the collective memory of campus activists","4217":"As the global opposition to the apartheid regime in South Africa had gathered pace, student activists at Dartmouth had constructed \u2018shanties\u2019 on the main college lawns (like today\u2019s \u2018encampments\u2019), to draw attention to the living conditions of black South Africans under the brutal white regime and to call for the college to divest from all companies doing business in South Africa","4218":"Obviously, these ramshackle shanties with activists camped out in them were an eyesore for those used to looking at the pristine beauty of the campus","4219":"But while the college administration threatened to remove them, it dithered on taking action because using force against peaceful protestors would have also created a PR disaster","4220":"Two months after the shanties were established, a group of right-wing students attacked them in the middle of the night \u2014 on Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s birthday, no less \u2014 with sledgehammers","4221":"The resulting outcry against the vandalism and violence led to the faculty of the college shutting down classes for a day to conduct teach-ins about prejudice and racism, the administrative block being briefly occupied by protestors and to the vandals being expelled or suspended from college","4222":"By the time I joined the college, the story of the shanties had become part of the lore of student activists but the movement for full divestment from South Africa continued to remain strong","4223":"The original Dartmouth Community for Divestment had strengthened alliances with other groups on and off campus \u2014 including one titled the Committee on Palestinian Rights \u2014 to form the Upper Valley Committee for a Free South Africa","4224":"And acts of protest continued off and on","4225":"It all came to a head in November 1989, when the administrative Parkhurst Hall was once again occupied by pro-divestment protestors and a group of us barged in on a trustee meeting","4226":"The college trustees, who managed the college endowment and investments, were forced to meet with the protestors and give a hearing to our demands","4227":"After a small group of activists also disrupted another trustee cocktail gathering, the college finally had had enough","4228":"A day later, the college president announced a full divestment from all companies doing business with apartheid South Africa","4229":"What\u2019s interesting to note is that, by this time, only two percent of Dartmouth\u2019s investments remained in companies that continued to operate in South Africa","4230":"Yet the college found it simpler to divest totally than to deal with the bad press the protests continued to bring to it","4231":"Similar protests were happening on many other campuses around the US as well","4232":"A few months later, Nelson Mandela had been freed from jail in South Africa after 27 years in captivity","4233":"A year after that, apartheid South Africa was no more","4234":"I recall all this history for two reasons","4235":"One, it is important to not underestimate the power of collective action","4236":"Obviously, there were plenty of other factors influencing South Africa\u2019s trajectory, especially the resistance movement within, and the apartheid regime stood isolated in most of the world from an ongoing cultural and state boycott","4237":"But every little bit of action \u2014 even in privileged US colleges thousands of miles away from the reality of South Africa \u2014 helped create the conditions for the final dismantling of apartheid","4238":"Eventually, it became just too costly in perceptual terms for multinational companies and states (such as the US) to continue to do business as normal with the apartheid regime","4239":"Two, for young student activists currently involved in the global protests against Israel\u2019s genocidal and apartheid regime, it is important to keep chipping away at it","4240":"There will inevitably be setbacks and change may not come immediately, but eventually critical mass will be reached","4241":"Despite the pressures (from institutions wielding power), despite the mischaracterisations of the movement (by the media and vested politicians), and despite the reactionary resistance to change (from those who stand to lose), the real power of moral clarity remains with those refusing to accept a genocide","4242":"It\u2019s also instructive to remember that Nelson Mandela \u2014 and his African National Congress \u2014 was labelled a \u2018terrorist\u2019 for the longest time by precisely those complicit Western powers that now refer to him as a saint","4243":"And that he never backed down from hitching the liberation of South Africa to the liberation of Palestine","4244":"Israel was a big supporter of the white apartheid regime","4245":"Ironically, the thing that Zionists have always hated the most is a comparison between Israel and apartheid South Africa","4246":"With their brutality in Gaza and the rest of Palestine, they have now successfully ensured that no one can ignore this comparison without being on the wrong side of history","4247":"The writer is a journalist and filmmaker and Dawn\u2019s Editor

first time \u2014 efforts complicated by Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza","4348":"Prince Mohammed, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, and Sullivan discussed \u201cthe semi-final version of the draft strategic agreements between the kingdom and the United States of America, the work on which is close to being completed\u201d, according to Saudi state media","4349":"The two sides also discussed \u201cwhat is being worked on between the two sides on the Palestinian issue to find a credible path towards a two-state solution\u201d","4350":"The talks also touched on \u201cthe situation in Gaza and the necessity of stopping the war there, and facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid\u201d","4351":"Sullivan is scheduled to visit Israel later on Sunday for talks about the conflict, according to the White House","4352":"The Biden administration has been seeking for some time to reach an agreement under which Saudi Arabia would recognise Israel in exchange for a stronger security relationship with Washington, which is already its most important security partner","4353":"The Saudis are also bargaining hard for help developing a civilian nuclear programme","4354":"Last September, before Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the conflict in Gaza, Prince Mohammed said in an interview with the US network Fox News that \u201cevery day we get closer\u201d to a deal to normalise ties","4355":"But those efforts have been severely damaged by the more than seven months of fighting in Gaza and the rising civilian toll there","4356":"The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures","4357":"Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 35,386 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to data provided by the health ministry","4358":"Since the outbreak of the conflict, Saudi officials have said that relations with Israel are impossible without steps toward recognising a Palestinian state, something Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long opposed","4359":"It is unclear whether Riyadh and Washington will move forward with their agreements, as Saudi Arabia and Israel have not reached a normalisation agreement, according to analysts","4360":"But high-level talks about what Saudi Arabia wants from the United States have continued","4361":"During Blinken\u2019s last visit to Riyadh in April, he and his Saudi counterpart said that a final agreement on the US-Saudi component of the deal was close","4362":"The investment decisions of Pakistan\u2019s private sector, led by a few large family-owned business groups, are influenced by a myriad of factors","4363":"While the interest rate may be a consideration, historical evidence suggests it\u2019s not necessarily the key determinant shaping investment trajectories in the country","4364":"All other factors are excluded here to gain a better insight into the relationship between the interest rate and investment","4365":"Over the last five years, the interest rate has more than doubled since May 2019, when it was 10","4366":"7 per cent, and tripled since June 2020, rising from 7pc to the current 22pc","4367":"Surprisingly, despite this significant increase, the investment-to-GDP rate has not crashed \u2014 it has only fallen by a modest 2","4368":"4pc, from 15","4369":"7pc in May 2019 to 13","4370":"3pc currently, according to official data","4371":"In a nation of 240 million, plagued by a succession of crises and faced by the looming threat of public discontent erupting into the streets, the issue at hand is pertinent enough to warrant systematic research efforts","4372":"Such endeavours may aim to inform evidence-based policy interventions geared towards stimulating investment and unlocking the country\u2019s economic potential","4373":"Despite a significant rise in interest rate to 22pc, investment-to-GDP fell by only 2","4374":"4pc, highlighting a curious relationship between the two factorsAt first glance, factors such as global investment climate (adversely impacted by the pandemic in the period under review), political instability, erratic economic policies, prioritisation of resource mobilisation over investment needs, excessive government interference in business affairs and security concerns have all cast a shadow on investment sentiments","4375":"In addition to the well-known factors mentioned above, often highlighted by business bodies, the intriguing relationship between interest rates and investment in Pakistan sheds light on certain unique aspects of the country\u2019s ground realities","4376":"It\u2019s difficult to dismiss the possibility of access to substantial amounts of unaccounted funds circulating within the economy finding their way to the investor class in Pakistan","4377":"In private conversations, numerous top businessmen have confessed to maintaining multiple accounting books, revealing that their recorded activities represent only a fraction of their actual business scale","4378":"They justify this practice by citing examples of misguided, wasteful public spending and argue that their hidden wealth is utilised effectively and efficiently in private endeavours","4379":"Another important factor that emerged during background research was faith-related","4380":"Some affluent oligarchs disclosed that they avoid the banking system due to religious beliefs prohibiting interest (Riba)","4381":"In response to a request for comments on the anomaly under discussion, some prominent tycoons and business executives defended their class while advocating for the State Bank to revise its interest rate downward","4382":"Muhammad Ali Tabba, CEO of Lucky Group, refrained from commenting on the issue raised and instead offered a note of cautious optimism","4383":"\u201cIt all depends on the investment policy","4384":"In an investment-friendly environment with competitive energy prices, I am pretty confident that investment will begin to flow again,\u201d he remarked","4385":"Gohar Eijaz, a prominent channel owner, property developer, leader of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, and former caretaker federal minister for commerce, industry, production, and interior, shared a detailed response sidelining the debate","4386":"He noted that high inflation rates have historically compelled the SBP to maintain elevated policy rates","4387":"He highlighted, \u201cThe government is the biggest bank borrower in Pakistan, with over 70pc of public savings invested in government bonds, while less than 20pc is borrowed by the private sector, mainly for working capital","4388":"\u201cIn a country where high interest rates are used to manage cost-push inflation, it often results in substantial fiscal deficits and productivity loss in the private sector","4389":"However, the situation is improving, with inflation now falling due to stable currency, improved macroeconomic conditions, zero current account deficit, a 10pc increase in exports, and a 38pc devaluation in the past two years","4390":"\u201cIncreased market demand has spurred production","4391":"To lower interest rates, the initial focus should be on reviving growth by optimising existing capacity and encouraging new investments","4392":"\u201d Nasim Beg, CEO of Arif Habib Consultancy and a seasoned executive on multiple company boards, noted, \u201cHistorically, the total return on equity investment in Pakistan has averaged around 20pc","4393":"During periods of single-digit interest rates, many businesses invested in capital expenditure [capex] using a mix of debt and equity [typically a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio]","4394":"Therefore, with rates around 10pc, borrowing was considered beneficial for businesses","4395":"\u201cThe high interest rates have several adverse effects, such as businesses that borrowed long-term funds for capital expenditure being severely affected \u2014 since long-term borrowing is on floating rates \u2014 undermining the feasibility of the incurred cost","4396":"The cost-carrying inventory rises due to expensive working capital borrowing, while high interest rates divert investible capital towards debt instruments from equity investment","4397":"\u201cFurthermore, hiring to support growth stagnates, leading to higher unemployment and lower per capita purchasing power, fueling a vicious cycle","4398":"High interest rates also inversely impact stocks\u2019 price-earning (PE) ratios, resulting in lower PEs","4399":"This forces businesses to sell stocks cheaply to attract growth capital, exacerbating the negative cycle","4400":"Finally, leveraged buyers in the equity market shy away from leveraging at high rates, dampening market activity","4401":"\u201d Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, May 13th, 2024","4402":"Pakistan leads the world in the tragic toll of neonatal, infant, and child mortality; the highest rate of first day deaths and stillbirths \u2014 future of promises snuffed out before they even begin","4403":"As of 2022, statistics reveal that 57 out of every 1,000 livebirths end in the child\u2019s death indicating that Pakistan stands at the precipice of a healthcare crisis, where diseases claim the lives of children with alarming frequency","4404":"What\u2019s worse is that the vast majority of these losses are preventable, succumbing to diseases that could have been stopped in their tracks by simple vaccinations","4405":"Against the backdrop of such a grim reality, World Immunisation Week, celebrated from April 24 to April 30, is a global initiative that stands as a powerful reminder of the lifesaving role of vaccines in safeguarding our most vulnerable and shaping a healthier world for generations to come","4406":"In Pakistan, as in every corner of the globe, understanding immunisation schedules, dispelling misconceptions, and fostering collective action are key to ensuring the success of immunisation efforts","4407":"However, perhaps the most pivotal strategy in our arsenal lies in confronting head-on the missed opportunities of vaccination (MOV)","4408":"This, we believe, is the game changer \u2014the silver bullet \u2014 that can transform our aspirations into realities, ensuring that no child is left behind, that no precious life is robbed of the shield of immunity they deserve","4409":"MOV encompasses any interaction with healthcare services involving a child eligible for immunisation \u2014 meaning they are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated for their age and lack any contraindication to immunisation \u2014 but fail to receive it by the end of that interaction","4410":"This missed opportunity can occur during scheduled vaccination visits, preventive services, routine check-ups like growth monitoring and nutrition assessments, as well as visits related to an illness","4411":"It can even happen during visits to healthcare facilities while accompanying a sick relative or family member","4412":"Each MOV poses a dual threat to both personal and community health by increasing the likelihood of vaccine-preventable diseases","4413":"In countries like Pakistan, where achieving the target of optimal immunisation coverage is already a challenge, addressing and mitigating these missed chances could substantially enhance child health metrics, including growth, development, and reducing mortality rates among children under five years old","4414":"MOV occur due to a myriad of factors, involving the child, caregiver, and the healthcare system and provider","4415":"These encompass instances such as illness coinciding with scheduled immunisation appointments and social disparities, where children from disadvantaged backgrounds face hurdles due to financial limitations or restricted access to healthcare services","4416":"Caregiver-related causes include inadequate education, diminished belief in susceptibility to diseases, apprehensions regarding vaccine side effects, propagation of myths and misconceptions, distrust in the healthcare system, cultural constraints based on gender, and a lack of prioritisation for immunisation, at times exacerbated by the misplacement of vaccination cards","4417":"Provider-related issues encompass insufficient training, staffing shortages, and constrained vaccination schedules or hours, resulting in missed vaccination opportunities","4418":"Programmatic policies, such as appointment-only visits, lengthy waiting periods in crowded facilities, designated immunisation days, daily limits on immunisations, and logistical obstacles like transportation issues, also contribute to the problem","4419":"Furthermore, despite well-structured immunisation processes, external challenges such as regional conflicts, natural calamities, population migration, and political influences exert adverse effects on vaccine coverage and utilisation","4420":"In the wake of the 2022 floods, a joint survey by the World Bank and Aga Khan University unearthed stark regional divides in immunisation coverage","4421":"While the aftermath of the floods undoubtedly contributed to infrastructure loss and the disappearance of immunisation records, numerous other factors loom large in this narrative","4422":"As highlighted earlier, rural and peri-urban regions, grappling with lower literacy rates and limited healthcare accessibility, face an uphill battle in locating and reaching remote immunisation facilities","4423":"Consequently, these areas harbour a disproportionate number of children with zero vaccine doses, in stark contrast to urban counterparts blessed with robust health infrastructure and ample healthcare knowledge dissemination","4424":"The emergence of pockets of zero dose children in these marginalised areas underscores an urgent call for resource mobilisation","4425":"It\u2019s clear that bridging these disparities demands a concerted effort to bolster healthcare accessibility and education, ensuring that no child is left vulnerable to the ravages of preventable diseases","4426":"To truly enhance child health indicators, we must first confront the various obstacles standing in our way","4427":"It begins with a simple yet crucial step: identifying zero dose children at every healthcare encounter and meticulously documenting their status","4428":"But the key to transformative change lies in the creation of a synchronised database linked to the country\u2019s National Database and Registration Authority, Nadra \u2014 which could be the linchpin of our surveillance and detection efforts against missed opportunities for vaccination","4429":"Automated individualised information tools such as text message-based reminders have long been heralded as powerful tools for disseminating public service messages","4430":"Leveraging this technology, we can revolutionise immunisation outreach by providing timely, personalised information to each child registered in the database","4431":"These automated reminders would guide caregivers and parents to the nearest healthcare facility or immunisation centre, with detailed directions and scheduling information","4432":"However, our efforts must not stop there","4433":"In areas with internet connectivity, we must empower caregivers with the knowledge to locate nearby immunisation centres independently","4434":"By equipping them with the tools to navigate local GPS or web mapping systems, we remove yet another barrier to access, ensuring that no child is left behind in the quest for better health","4435":"Directions provided by the author\nOn the national scale, the Lady Health Workers (LHW) programme has shown to be a cost-effective approach and has received extensive community support","4436":"Expansion of this programme would not only help reinforce trust with vaccinators and improve immunisation coverage but would also serve to increase access to health education","4437":"Many rural or underserved areas lack adequate health information, and this expansion would empower communities to make informed health choices, fostering a positive cultural shift in immunisation practices","4438":"Moreover, enhancing disease surveillance systems and establishing a national database would streamline case reporting, communication, and disaster response","4439":"This database would pinpoint areas most affected by vaccine preventable diseases and identify high-risk clusters, enabling targeted interventions and redirect focus towards strategies to address MOV","4440":"Furthermore, refining the national immunisation plan would enhance the country\u2019s ability to recognise and overcome immunisation challenges promptly and effectively","4441":"In the context of MOV, the theme of World Immunisation Week this year is particularly important for Pakistan, as it resonates deeply with the challenges and opportunities we face in the realm of immunisation","4442":"It is a reminder that immunisation programmes, while complex, are entirely within our reach if we harness the collective power of the government, healthcare professionals, researchers, the community and technology","4443":"A child needs only five visits during the first year and one visit during the second year of his\/her life to complete the vaccination with six visits against 12 dreadful diseases","4444":"With unyielding dedication and community support, this milestone in healthcare is not merely attainable; it\u2019s a testament to our collective commitment to the well-being of our children and society as a whole","4445":"Header image: A health worker marks the finger of a child after administering polio vaccine drops during a door-to-door campaign in Lahore on July 20, 2020","4446":"\u2014 AFP\/File","4447":"I have a long-time acquaintance who moved to Pakistan from Malaysia when he was almost an adult","4448":"For the sake of his privacy, let\u2019s call him Junaid","4449":"He is a globe-trotting critic \u2014 the kind of acquaintance you can\u2019t shake off, no matter how hard you try","4450":"He swapped the palm-fringed shores of Malaysia for the bustling streets of Pakistan, bringing along more than just his luggage; he brought his opinions too, and boy, does he love to share them","4451":"Having also lived a few years in Saudi Arabia, he\u2019s now busy comparing us to a country that could buy and sell us as a side project, and still telling us how terrible this country is","4452":"From bashing Pakistan to praising the latest country he\u2019s set foot in, Junaid\u2019s commentary is as consistent as the sunrise","4453":"Fast forward to our latest encounter right after the elections \u2014 Junaid, unable to cast his own vote because he couldn\u2019t get himself a CNIC from Nadra for unknown reasons \u2014 found joy in ridiculing those who did","4454":"He laughed about how \u2018stupid\u2019 PTI supporters were for thinking that voting was going to change the country","4455":"Now, this is an obnoxious man, so I take his comments with a pinch of salt","4456":"But he\u2019s not alone in his disdain","4457":"A journalist in Islamabad, alongside a Twitter columnist, joined the chorus, labelling PTI supporters as everything from \u2018uninformed\u2019 and \u2018ignorant\u2019 to \u2018over-zealous ideologues\u2019 and \u2018fanatics\u2019","4458":"But Pakistan isn\u2019t just a battleground for political debates","4459":"It\u2019s a free-for-all where everyone is itching to tell you how to live, how to pray, and even how to think","4460":"There\u2019s a Junaid in every corner, ready to school you on the \u201ccorrect\u201d way to practice Islam or why your political views are outdated, leaving no room for alternative voices \u2014 not in politics, not in religion, and not even in culture","4461":"Pakistan seems to be split into a minority of two extremes \u2014 the liberals and the religious \u2014 whose voices are the loudest","4462":"In the meantime, no one knows what the vast majority of Pakistan wants, because no one is listening","4463":"Most of us are stuck in the middle, drowned out by the roar of extremism on both ends, silently wondering: \u201cWhat about us","4464":"\u201dIn the global spotlight, there\u2019s a dialogue we\u2019re missing out on","4465":"While Israel ramps up its genocidal assault on Palestine (because let\u2019s not forget the escalating violence by the Israelis in the West Bank, despite our focus on Gaza), a new cognisance about colonialism has taken hold","4466":"In their efforts to bring their cause to light, Palestinian voices in the diaspora are leading the charge, exposing colonialism for the ugly truth that it is","4467":"Through decades of patient campaigning and organising, Palestinian civil society has raised an awareness across the Global South of the devastation colonialism wrought, its lasting scars and its modern-day manifestations","4468":"In Pakistan, we have also recognised this, but we seem unable to emerge from that looming shadow","4469":"Our leaders are both deeply embedded in the neo-colonial capitalist structures and snake pits of the Global North \u2014 more concerned with their own pockets than their country","4470":"Their collective visions of Pakistan\u2019s future are borrowed from the Middle East or the West, while our intellectual class remains fixated on India","4471":"Our leaders completely abrogate any responsibility while the majority of Pakistanis are left to fend for themselves, trapped in poverty, illiteracy, and injustice","4472":"Small sections of civil society are helping to alleviate some of these issues, but unless they can scale up at a phenomenal rate, there is little chance that they\u2019ll do more than apply band-aids to the seething wounds inflicted upon us","4473":"Meanwhile, if there is some semblance of organisation within society, some spark of engagement and participatory citizenship \u2014 however you may dislike how they participate \u2014 we are quick to shut it down with contempt, derision, and indifference","4474":"This is the same contempt a feudal feels for his serfs","4475":"The same contempt I\u2019ve seen middle-class women hold for their domestic staff","4476":"The same contempt a school owner in a Katchi Abadi in Karachi has for his students (\u201cWhy give them parathas when all they\u2019re used to are rotis","4477":"\u201d)","4478":"This isn\u2019t just a lack of empathy; it\u2019s a legacy of colonialism ingrained in our society","4479":"It\u2019s the language of the British Raj internalised, absorbed, and well-padded with expensive foreign educations in neo-colonial USA or through Saudi Arabia\u2019s deliberate attempt to spread Salafism","4480":"Just as we continue to battle the quest for \u2018fair skin\u2019 \u2014 our deep-seated gora complex \u2014 and the drive to bury our native languages in favour of English, we should recognise that we\u2019ve inherited this attitude of contempt from our oppressors","4481":"After the 1857 War of Independence (which is still referred to in the UK as the Mutiny), Lord Elphinstone wrote:\u201cI have long considered the subject, and I am convinced that the exact converse of this policy of assimilation is our only safe military policy in India","4482":"Divide et impera (divide and rule) was the old Roman motto, and it should be ours","4483":"The safety of the great iron steamers, which are adding so much to our military power, and which are probably destined to add still more to our commercial superiority, is greatly increased by building them in compartments","4484":"I would ensure the safety of our Indian Empire by constructing our native army on the same principle; for this purpose I would avail myself of those divisions of language and race we find ready to hand","4485":"\u201dSimilarly, Brigadier John Coke, an officer in the North West Frontier (before it became a province of Pakistan), said:\u201cOur endeavour should be to uphold in full force the (fortunate for us) separation which exists between the different religions and races, and not to endeavour to amalgamate them","4486":"Divide et impera should be the principle of Indian Government","4487":"\u201d [sic]Years earlier, Lord Macaulay had already started the process of breaking down the subcontinent\u2019s existing education system","4488":"Having received an extensive grant for investing in education for the \u2018natives\u2019, he was hesitant to invest in existing materials which were all in either Persian, Urdu (which he called Arabic), or Sanskrit","4489":"He lobbied strongly to replace all oriental literature with English books, because he \u201cnever found one among them (orientalists) who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia","4490":"The intrinsic superiority of the Western literature is, indeed, fully admitted by those members of the committee who support the oriental plan of education","4491":"\u201dLord Macaulay relished the idea of educating the Indian into \u201ca class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect","4492":"\u201dThe British wanted us divided","4493":"They also considered us unable to progress on our own without their superior intellect and help","4494":"The US feels no differently","4495":"Nor does Saudi Arabia","4496":"Both countries have continued to colonise us and divide us","4497":"Where once we longed to be British, we now long to be American or Arab (the rich Arabs, that is","4498":"No one here yearns to be a Yemeni)","4499":"We educate our children in US universities","4500":"We internalise their language and their ideologies","4501":"These children return to their home countries to bring enlightenment to us","4502":"They bring back with them not solutions to the daily struggles of a family of 10 who can\u2019t save for their futures, but principles of capitalism, secularism, liberalism, and rationalism that only serve to crush any last vestiges of identity the population is still clinging on to","4503":"Meanwhile, those coming from the Middle East bring with them the outward trappings of Salafism  and a complete disdain for Sufism, our music, our poetry, our rituals and customs, disregarding them all as either \u2018innovations\u2019 in Islam or superstitions learned from Hindus","4504":"And this is possibly the logic (and I can find no other logic for it) behind the division of Pakistan into two non-contiguous land masses","4505":"A small example of this attitude is the hugely popular Coke Studio","4506":"Leaving aside the irony of a programme sponsored by a global corporation that abets apartheid in Palestine and represents the worst aspects of capitalism, the programme itself is instrumental in reminding our middle classes of the great Sufi legacy we can and should remember, revere, and tap into","4507":"However, as one former colleague of mine put it, it\u2019s too \u2018populist\u2019 for him","4508":"Suggesting music from Coke Studio at my previous place of work (with a select few, all of whom were educated abroad and belong to the upper crust of society) will return a turned up nose and much mocking","4509":"Salafists, on the other hand, simply dismiss music as \u2018unIslamic\u2019, and have the same reaction to the popularity of the programme","4510":"In all cases, these segments of society view each other and the vast majority of their fellow citizens (who don\u2019t agree with them) with complete and utter contempt","4511":"Britain\u2019s iron steamers left a long time ago","4512":"Whatever veneer of civilisation the Global North had has been well and truly stripped since this latest war on Gaza, along with it any notion that Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, could be the spiritual leader of the Ummah","4513":"The United States\u2019 own domestic affairs are in a deep divide","4514":"Evidence of the corruption of their leadership, judiciary, media, and political system is visible for the whole world to see","4515":"Its social poles keep moving further and further apart","4516":"If we must learn from empire, perhaps this is what we should be looking at: what not to do with our own societies","4517":"It\u2019s time we stopped scoffing at each other\u2019s views","4518":"It\u2019s time we stopped dismissing the other for their desi accents or local brand of shoes","4519":"It\u2019s time we turned inwards in contemplation; remember that we are all, from all parts of the country, human beings whose diversity gives us strength rather than dividing us","4520":"It\u2019s time we moved beyond the circles of school and family that keep widening the rift between the silent majority and the vocal few","4521":"Start by actually speaking to the people (which is something that none of the reigning political parties do either) and finding out what they really want, rather than assuming you know what is best for them","4522":"Start by listening with the respect we learned from our elders, not the crude superiority of the white man towards the brown

half-centuries \u2014 after the side had lost openers Babar and Saim in the powerplay","4527":"That they still went on the attack despite losing early wickets, showed Pakistan were addressing longstanding issues over their striking rate, which had been subject to criticism given how top sides in the world are considering 200 runs a par score in T20Is","4528":"Fakhar, who smashed 78 off 40 with the help of six fours and as many sixes, said Pakistan were shook by the defeat in the first match","4529":"\u201cWe needed a wake-up call, the way we lost the first match,\u201d Fakhar said

against New Zealand, is being a full run against Ireland and he repaid the team management\u2019s trust with a blistering finishing knock of 30 off 10 balls","4535":"The burly batter smacked the Ireland bowlers for four sixes and a four to take Pakistan over the line with 19 balls to spare","4536":"Azam\u2019s show, coming in at number five, must have given the national side some hope of

was celebrated as a landmark for the #MeToo movement, where women accused hundreds of men in entertainment, media, politics, and other sectors of sexual misconduct","4650":"\u201cThere was nothing consensual about this conduct,\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg stated","4651":"\u201cWe believe in this case and will be retrying it","4652":"\u201dWeinstein, 72, had been serving a 23-year sentence in a prison in upstate Rome, New York","4653":"Following last week\u2019s order, he was transferred to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, according to his spokesperson, Juda Engelmayer","4654":"Farber remanded Weinstein back into custody and expressed his intention to hold a new trial after the Labour Day holiday, although no definitive date was set","4655":"Labour Day is on September

\u2018not guilty,\u2019\u201d he continued","4660":"Aidala mentioned that Weinstein would return to Bellevue","4661":"In February 2020, jurors in Manhattan convicted Weinstein of sexually assaulting former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006 and raping aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013","4662":"They are among more than 80 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct","4663":"The conviction included charges of first-degree sexual assault and third-degree rape","4664":"Weinstein, who has consistently denied engaging in non-consensual sexual encounters, was acquitted of other charges","4665":"Haley\u2019s solicitor, Gloria Allred, informed reporters that she has not yet decided whether she will testify again at the trial, citing the traumatising nature of the experience","4666":"\u201cThat testimony was obviously believed by the jury, and in addition, Mimi\u2019s testimony was not the only evidence presented,\u201d Allred stated","4667":"Last week, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that Judge James Burke, who presided over the trial, made a critical error by allowing three women to testify about alleged sexual assaults by Weinstein that were not part of the criminal charges against him","4668":"The court declared that this \u201cprior bad acts\u201d testimony violated his right to a fair trial","4669":"Weinstein was also sentenced to 16 years following his separate rape trial in California","4670":"The two sentences cannot be served concurrently","4671":"California law grants prosecutors greater leeway to introduce \u201cprior bad

expensive overseas properties owned by the country\u2019s power elite, have not surprised the populace","4676":"Similarly, news of Pakistan\u2019s total debt and liabilities reaching a record Rs81 trillion due to economic mismanagement has failed to shock","4677":"Instead, social media reflects a sense of bemusement over the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee\u2019s (JAAC) success in achieving its demands","4678":"This disconnect highlights the differences in the priorities of the elites and the common people, which are exacerbating the nation\u2019s sociopolitical crisis","4679":"The juxtaposition of the contrasting news running on our TV screens is quite jarring","4680":"On one side, the federal finance minister is determined to eliminate tax exemptions for residents of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Provincially Administered Tribal Areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa","4681":"On the other, it is disclosed in the Punjab Assembly that state-owned land is being leased for a mere Rs417 per month for gymkhana clubs in the province","4682":"Such reports seem to justify the public anger at the state, an example of which can be seen in viral social media clips of an official in Azad Kashmir being humiliated for using a government vehicle to transport his pet dog","4683":"The JAAC\u2019s demands have been met","4684":"The risk of its protests turning even more violent had increased following the killing of three protesters, and it seems the government was not ready to take that kind of risk","4685":"The presence of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation in Islamabad seems to have contributed to the fulfilment of JAAC\u2019s demands, as the group had bluntly expressed doubts about the capabilities of state institutions amidst the heightened political uncertainty and renewed social tensions","4686":"These reports of widespread social unrest from Azad Jammu and Kashmir must have added to the IMF\u2019s anxieties","4687":"The government acted out of panic, likely hoping to avoid derailing its talks with the IMF for another bailout programme over the sociopolitical unrest in Azad Kashmir","4688":"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif promptly approved a Rs23 billion ($82 million) subsidy programme to drastically reduce the price of wheat and flour, meeting a demand that the protesters had been raising for at least the last year","4689":"The JAAC had modelled its approach after the Awami Action Committee (AAC) of Gilgit-Baltistan, which has been active in ensuring the fulfilment of several local demands in recent years","4690":"Earlier this year, the AAC had secured a similar deal with the government for a wheat subsidy","4691":"Initially reluctant, the government seems to have conceded in both cases due to the strategic and economic significance of both GB and Azad Kashmir, particularly with respect to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor","4692":"These regions have historically benefited from tax and customs duty exemptions, widespread subsidies, and certain legal exemptions","4693":"There are many in Islamabad who have long voiced concerns that the exemptions given to the people of these areas have been draining Pakistan\u2019s economy","4694":"While concessionary policies may have benefited the elites in these regions, ordinary citizens have continued to struggle, and they rightly attribute their plight to the power elite","4695":"The people\u2019s reaction to the government\u2019s plans to introduce new taxation measures in former Fata and Pata is yet to be seen","4696":"It is uncertain how the government will react if mass movements akin to AAC and JAAC emerge: will it fold again in the face of adversity","4697":"The IMF\u2019s primary concern is that state institutions do not have a strategy to address the socio-political crisis","4698":"They either resort to extreme and violent measures or complete surrender","4699":"Such measures damage the state\u2019s ability to implement long-term structural reforms in the economic sector","4700":"The IMF assesses the government\u2019s capacity to implement stringent economic measures in a volatile environment, noting that a weak government is less capable of handling such challenges","4701":"The dilemma for state institutions lies in the fairness and constitutional validity of the public\u2019s demands, which are organic and devoid of significant political ambitions","4702":"The JAAC and AAC represent anti-elite movements challenging the existing political order","4703":"These movements, unlike the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement in KP and the Haq do Tehreek in Balochistan\u2019s Makran region, have so far avoided ethnic and nationalistic undertones","4704":"However, this could change if the government fails to fulfil its commitments","4705":"The government needs to navigate a delicate balance between satisfying the masses and meeting IMF requirements","4706":"The only sustainable solution is a comprehensive, long-term plan for socio-economic transformation \u2014 a task the power elite struggles to conceive, as it prefers firefighting and short-term crisis management","4707":"The populist movements discussed here have arisen mainly in peripheral regions, which are fighting for constitutional status or integration into the mainstream administrative system","4708":"For example, Gilgit-Baltistan has long demanded full provincial status, which was nearly achieved under Imran Khan\u2019s government","4709":"But plans were inexplicably stalled and have not been discussed again","4710":"Even though the state was finally able to \u2018mainstream\u2019 Fata after 75 years, it remains an ongoing challenge exacerbated by the increased securitisation of the region in recent years","4711":"Perhaps, instead of clamping down more tightly on both Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir when populist movements broke out, the state should have learnt from its mistakes in Fata and taken a more considered approach","4712":"Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir require mainstreaming in governance, economy and politics, and equal constitutional rights","4713":"Granting these rights could help legitimise and simplify the introduction of the tax reforms that the government envisages for these regions","4714":"However, the unstructured and unplanned handling of social transformation by change agents and the non-involvement of political parties, particularly ruling parties, has positioned them as adversaries to these movements","4715":"For a smooth transition, the power elites must fundamentally alter their behaviour, demonstrating their commitment to the people and the state","4716":"They must prioritise loyalty to the land and its citizens over personal gains","4717":"Symbolic gestures alone are insufficient to justify holding properties and assets abroad","4718":"The writer is a security

which lies in the shadow of the iconic Burj Khalifa","4758":"Even the extre\u00admely limited rental data available for the years that Dr Mukhtar appears as listed owner shows that the total income

expensive real estate in Dubai, he was allegedly running an illegal organ trafficking operation from his Rawalpindi hospital, the Kidney Centre","4761":"\u2018Agents\u2019 affiliated with his hospital

in recent years to unearth details of Pakistani citizens who own assets in Dubai with an aim to bring undeclared assets and income into the tax net","4819":"But they have made little headway","4820":"Dubai authorities are reluctant to share information about something as simple as the number of Pakistani citizens with Dubai residence visas, commonly known as iqamas or Emirates IDs","4821":"There is also a political element to the stonewalling: Pakistan doesn\u2019t have the geopolitical clout to demand this information","4822":"Today, those details \u2014 an astounding volume of leaked property data that includes over 23,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals up to the spring of 2022 \u2014 are at the fingertips of journalists from scores of media outlets around the world","4823":"The leaked data provides a detailed overview of hundreds of thousands of properties in Dubai and information about their ownership or usage, largely from 2020 and

data is not evidence in itself of financial crime or tax fraud","4831":"Nor does the data contain information such as residence status, sources of income, tax declarations of rental income or capital gains","4832":"In fact, several of those approached by Dawn for comment on their properties said they were declared to the tax authorities","4833":"But it does paint an astonishing picture of contrasts","4834":"Pakistan, a developing country teetering on the edge of economic collapse, begging international lenders and friendly countries for lifelines in single-digit billions, features prominently in the data","4835":"While 17,000 Pakistani citizens are listed owners in the 2022 leak, academics using the data and additional sources put the actual number of Pakistani owners of residential property in Dubai at 22,000","4836":"They further estimate that the apartments and villas may have been worth more than $10 billion at the start of 2022, but with the more than 25 per cent

not forthcoming about sharing information on iqamas, for instance, despite the existence of a tax treaty between the UAE and Pakistan to avoid double taxation","4846":"In 2019, the FBR in a strongly worded handout expressed its frustration at the silence of Dubai authorities on this issue, and threatened to terminate the treaty","4847":"And yet, the Dubai authorities remained tight-lipped","4848":"Speaking to Dawn, Mr Zaidi shares a revealing incident from the time he was FBR chairman","4849":"\u201c[In December 2019] I asked my director of taxes to get iqama details from Dubai authorities to identify which Pakistanis have Dubai iqamas, because those who own property in Dubai typically have iqamas","4850":"\u201d Soon after, he said, he was contacted by a senior diplomat who suggested he should not pursue the matter","4851":"The properties owned by Pakistanis range from studio apartments and commercial properties to entire buildings and six-bedroom villas","4852":"Pakistanis are listed as owners in some of Dubai\u2019s most expensive districts, including Dubai Marina, Emirates Hills, Business Bay, Palm Jumeirah and Al Barsha","4853":"\u201cI

minister]","4858":"IK called me and asked what I was doing","4859":"He said \u201cHaath haula rakho, they just gave us $1bn","4860":"\u201d Mr Khan was referring to the $3bn bailout package pledged by the UAE to Pakistan in January 2019","4861":"Mr Zaidi adds, \u201cBecause of Pakistan\u2019s bankruptcy and financial dependency on countries like the UAE, it cannot ask for this information","4862":"Dubai thrives on non-transparency, and doesn\u2019t want to share this information","4863":"\u201dAli Rahim, tax lawyer and former Karachi Tax Bar Association president, explains how tax laws apply to Pakistanis with overseas assets","4864":"\u201cThe entire world income of resident Pakistanis is liable to be taxed in Pakistan, but they can get credit against their total tax payment for any taxes paid abroad","4865":"\u201dPakistani residents (those in the country for more than 183 days per year) with assets abroad have to value them at the current exchange rate and pay one per cent tax on that if the value of the asset is more than Rs100 million","4866":"This law is being challenged in the high courts and the Supreme Court","4867":"Non-resident or overseas Pakistanis are only liable to pay tax on income generated in Pakistan","4868":"They are not required to file a wealth statement or declare overseas assets","4869":"Mr Rahim shares a troubling anecdote","4870":"\u201cSix or seven years ago, some government officials on a private visit to Dubai obtained details under false pretexts from various developers of properties owned by Pakistanis","4871":"They brought back CDs full of information and then began blackmailing those individuals for money","4872":"\u201dHe adds","4873":"\u201cLegally speaking, the same laws apply to politicians and PEPs (politically exposed persons) as well but we all know the factual position","4874":"I know of instances where PEPs\u2019 files have been put on the backburner and their cases have vanished into thin air","4875":"\u201dAccording to the Atlas of the Offshore World, compiled by the EU Tax Observatory and Norway\u2019s Skatteforsk Cente for Tax Research, offshore financial wealth (equities, bonds, mutual fund shares, and associated bank deposits) owned by Pakistan has declined from nearly 17pc in 2001 to 2pc in 2022","4876":"This is largely on account of the increasing transparency in the global banking system","4877":"Consider that in 2001, Pakistan\u2019s offshore financial wealth stashed away in Switzerland was $11bn","4878":"In 2022, that figure was down to $1bn","4879":"On the flip side, the growing transparency in the banking system incentivises a shift towards real estate","4880":"And Dubai is the favoured destination by far","4881":"Data gathered for the Atlas of the Offshore World shows that London, with $740m, comes in a distant second behind Dubai ($10bn plus) for Pakistanis looking to invest in offshore real estate","4882":"Singapore is third,

transactions","4886":"In 2019, Transparency International dubbed the emirate a \u2018money laundering paradise\u2019, highlighting that individuals with questionable sources of income are able to invest in Dubai without restrictions","4887":"A number of individuals that journalists with the OCCRP interviewed, including a former governor of a central bank in the region, spoke about parallel systems being in place","4888":"Two Arab lawyers with representative offices in the UAE told a journalist with OCCRP that there are two economic, financial and security systems running in parallel at the same time","4889":"One is formal where all rules and guidelines apply and which conforms to international requirements","4890":"The other operates outside the formal system; it survives on cuts from criminals, sanctioned persons and entities \u2014 shady investors and millionaires who don\u2019t like to be asked where they got their money","4891":"One of the lawyers said, \u201cPrivate jets full of money are landing frequently in Dubai","4892":"No one can ask who the money is for","4893":"It\u2019s taken out and deposited in special accounts\u2026\u201dIn early March, Diamant Salihu from Swedish Television did an in-person undercover interview for this project with a salesperson working with Damac, the property development company, at their sales office in Dubai","4894":"When

partners to disrupt and deter all forms of illicit finance","4904":"The UAE is committed to continuing these efforts and actions more than ever today and over the longer term","4905":"\u201dTo support its contention, the embassy cited the following figures: \u201cThe UAE has issued fines of more than AED 115 million in relation to money laundering\u201d and \u201cseized assets of more than AED 925 million in relation to breaches of AML practices and procedures\u201d","4906":"Dubai was added to the FATF\u2019s grey list in 2022 but was taken off in February 2024","4907":"Some experts, however,

particularly serious blind spot in international information exchange","4909":"Just like financial assets, there are many legitimate reasons for holding real estate abroad, but there are also concerns that offshore real estate, in some cases, may be used for money laundering, tax evasion, escaping international sanctions, or other financial crimes","4910":"The attractiveness of real estate as an asset class lies in its relatively stable value over time, the possibility to manipulate prices, and possibilities for anonymous ownership in countries with weak property registers","4911":"\u201dThat is what makes the Dubai property leaks so fascinating, because they give us a glimpse into how well-heeled Pakistanis play the real estate market in their favourite offshore investment

shocking material in the Justices\u2019 letter to the SJC","4959":"\u201cWhere was this courage when Justice Shaukat Siddiqui was targeted","4960":"\u201d they ask, equally rhetorically, in response to praise meted to the Justices, for the latter\u2019s attempt to stand by their oaths","4961":"Those who read diligently, and enjoy craniums free of tinfoil hats, need only peruse paragraph six of the Justices\u2019 letter to observe that their contentions did not originate overnight","4962":"It appears that, by May 3, 2023, both the Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court and the Chief Justice of Pakistan had been apprised of the Justices\u2019 objections","4963":"The letter details follow-up meetings","4964":"Nothing came of them, until the apex court took cognisance of the matter (more on this later)","4965":"Those deriding the Justices for not taking a stand for Justice Siddiqui, perhaps conveniently, ignore the fact that five of the six judges were not even on the bench in 2018","4966":"Information available on the subject does not show that any of the six opposed Justice Siddiqui\u2019s cause, so any apathy to Justice Siddiqui\u2019s plight cannot be inferred","4967":"The situation, today, is materially different \u2014 five of these six Justices are no longer private persons, but constitutional office-holders, tasked with dispensing justice","4968":"This captures how the debate on timing only obfuscates the thornier issue \u2014 do we displace our preference for judicial impartiality, if we accept the premise that the Justices were not active enough in condemning what came before","4969":"Would one\u2019s perception of the adequacy of their earlier response be the metric for determining whether the Justices may seek insulation from intimidation","4970":"Surely not","4971":"We want judges to only be guided by their conscience and intellect when they issue verdicts","4972":"Therefore, an attack on their independence should elicit consternation, and not cynicism","4973":"Plenty of reasons have been provided for the former, all rooted in the Justices\u2019 inability to, individually, counter the invasion of their privacy or the torture of their loved ones","4974":"The law on contempt does not permit the Justices to initiate contempt proceedings where they are parties to the dispute; the law only permits the Justices to \u201crefer\u201d the matter to the chief justice, and this referral, by the Justices, did not bear fruit","4975":"The code of conduct too does not prescribe a mechanism for reporting the executive\u2019s meddling in the Justices\u2019 sphere of operation","4976":"When Justice Siddiqui spoke out, the SJC found him guilty of misconduct for breaching the same code; his six-year legal battle culminated only in \u201cbenefits and privileges of a retired Judge\u201d","4977":"Justice Siddiqui\u2019s exoneration did, however, demonstrate the extent of executive intrusion in the judiciary\u2019s affairs, reaching the point where a nation-wide reckoning within the institution is necessary to formulate a coherent push-back strategy","4978":"Armed only with the pen in a sword-fight with the executive, the Justices, recognising their limitations, now seek such \u201cinstitutional consultation\u201d among their brethren","4979":"Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani agreed with this approach, opting to recuse himself from the prime minister\u2019s one-man inquiry commission; safeguarding his legacy in the process, he posits that the matter is best left to the SJC or the Supreme Court","4980":"With the one-man inquiry commission having lost its only man, the committee constituted under Section 3 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, ended up agreeing with Justice Jillani","4981":"Out came the notification that the Supreme Court is taking suo motu notice of the matter, leading to the first hearing on Wednesday, April 3","4982":"The high courts\u2019 inability to immunise against executive overreach, naturally, trickles down to the lower courts, where judges are more susceptible than their high court counterparts","4983":"This vulnerability affects litigants throughout the system, which should concern us","4984":"Impressive though the Justices\u2019 crusade to uphold their oath has been, being forced to fight this fight at all should concern us","4985":"And the fact that \u2014 even when truth is being spoken to power \u2014 some of us have conveniently forgotten first principles, regardless of how intuitive these principles may be, should concern us","4986":"Some of these concerns appear to have registered with the Supreme Court","4987":"Wednesday\u2019s hearing contained multiple references to the \u201cindependence of the judiciary\u201d and the need to determine \u201cthe way forward\u201d, for which a full bench of the court may hear the rest of the case","4988":"During the hearing, the CJP poignantly remarked that the proceedings would prompt listeners to open law books and read them carefully enough","4989":"Solely dusting off the treatises, however, may not be enough; as plenty quote,

his allegation","5004":"\u201cIt is in the notice of this court that in a number of cases, citizens are arrested without any incriminating evidence on record of the case of their involvement,\u201d the judge observed, adding that the practice on part of the CTD police was a sheer abuse of power","5005":"He added that it was noted with concern that despite the discharge of the accused by the court in similar cases in the past, no visible change in the mindset and actions of CTD police was noticed","5006":"\u201cThis court considers such an approach on part of the CTD police not in favour of the national interest","5007":"It rather damages not only the prestige of the CTD police but also shatters the confidence of the public in the system of the nation, including the judiciary,\u201d he observed","5008":"The court observed that state organisations were meant to enhance public welfare and the trust of the public in state institutions","5009":"It added that if the work of those

of what bolting is about","5044":"It is a natural seed-producing mechanism of the plant at the end of its life cycle","5045":"Sometimes, however, this mechanism occurs much earlier due to various reasons, which we discussed in our article last week","5046":"The eventual outcome of early, unwanted bolting is that it reduces the fruit production of the plant, both in quality and quantity","5047":"In such cases, the growth, size, taste and texture of the harvest are inhibited, which ultimately leads to the premature removal of the plant by the gardener","5048":"In normal circumstances, at the end of the season, the plant bolts after undergoing its entire life cycle","5049":"It is a win-win situation for any gardener who optimally uses the growing space","5050":"The parent plant ends up producing the characteristic, flower-laden, woody stalk having seeds within, for the next cycle of the same crop to be grown after a few months","5051":"Not only that, the bolting phase is sometimes visually appealing as well","5052":"Early bolting in plants can impact the quality and quantity of the fruit it produces, inhibiting the growth, size, taste and texture of the harvestFor instance, as summer commences, the growing space dedicated to the greens \u2014 such as dill, lettuce and other herbs \u2014 begins to wilt away under the scorching heat and sunlight","5053":"The gardening area for these leafy herbs and vegetables, which would otherwise remain green throughout the season, will then be aesthetically intertwined with flowers of white, yellow and other colours during the bolting phase","5054":"Yet another benefit of the presence of bolting flowers is the attraction of pollinators to your garden","5055":"As bees, butterflies and other insects make their way to the bolting flowers of the greens, they help in pollinating the buds and flowers of the summer season herbs, vegetables and fruits as well","5056":"This is especially beneficial for the likes of the family of gourds, including bottle gourds and apple gourds, and even cucumbers, okra, beans, eggplants and many more","5057":"The advantages of bolting are, thus, maximally utilised, when they are obtained in a timely manner at the end of the plant\u2019s life cycle","5058":"Many people question whether chopping off the characteristic bolting stem would stop the bolting from occurring in the first place","5059":"Sadly, that\u2019s not the case","5060":"You cannot stop the bolting of a plant once it has started","5061":"Period","5062":"The one thing that you can do is to delay it","5063":"And, yes, chopping off the stem is likely to delay the bolting","5064":"The pruning of the stem and pinching of the flowers is one of the most common steps that gardeners undertake to delay bolting","5065":"Other than pinching the buds and pruning off the stem, regular harvesting of produce is also recommended to delay bolting","5066":"Gardeners adopt many other ways to delay the process of bolting from occurring earlier than anticipated","5067":"Let\u2019s see what else can be done to avoid unwanted and untimely bolting from taking place","5068":"Watering and hydration, or lack of it, is one of the most important and crucial factors when it comes to untimely bolting","5069":"While overwatering may kill the plant, reduced or lack of watering may push it towards bolting, as it is a shocking condition for the plant","5070":"During heat waves and dry spells, it is critical to water your plants accordingly","5071":"Boosting the soil surface with mulch and manure to ensure water retention and covering the plant with shade from direct sunlight exposure in extreme heat, to avoid water evaporation, may go a long way in ensuring plant hydration","5072":"Mulch may include wood shavings, dead leaves and compost","5073":"To a certain extent, mulch provides insulation between the approaching sunlight heat and the plant soil","5074":"The plant with a potential for early bolting should be regularly watered","5075":"On the contrary, summer season herbs and vegetables love direct sunlight exposure","5076":"The plant might grow lanky, if it is not provided with the recommended sunlight","5077":"This stressed climate may also induce early seeds, resulting in bolting","5078":"In this scenario, the potted plant should be brought closer to the sunlight exposure","5079":"Fluctuation in temperature and climate variation should also be adequately addressed","5080":"When purchasing seeds from the nearby stores and nurseries, always check the instruction part on the back side of the packet","5081":"Some packets highlight the fact that the seeds within the packet are heat tolerant or bolting resistant","5082":"You should opt for them if you have the option","5083":"Similarly, from germinating to thinning out the weaker seedlings, from growing the selected seedlings to transplanting to a new place and boosting the plant with required nourishment, always give preference to the strong seedlings, while discarding the weaker ones in the compost bin","5084":"While purchasing seedlings, always opt for the stronger ones as well","5085":"Moreover, try to ensure better spacing between the plants","5086":"Too many plants growing in close proximity to each other, or within the same pot, is likely to cause a struggle for nourishment and be a stress factor for the plant","5087":"Finally, the most important and logical way to avoid untimely bolting is to sow the seeds and grow the plant at the exact recommended time of the year, according to the region you reside in","5088":"*Please send your queries and emails to \t\t\t","5089":"The writer is a physician and a host for the YouTube

delegation in Islamabad seems to have contributed to the fulfilment of JAAC\u2019s demands, as the group had bluntly expressed doubts about the capabilities of state institutions amidst the heightened political uncertainty and renewed social tensions","5101":"These reports of widespread social unrest from Azad Jammu and Kashmir must have added to the IMF\u2019s anxieties","5102":"The government acted out of panic, likely hoping to avoid derailing its talks with the IMF for another bailout programme over the sociopolitical unrest in Azad Kashmir","5103":"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif promptly approved a Rs23 billion ($82 million) subsidy programme to drastically reduce the price of wheat and flour, meeting a demand that the protesters had been raising for at least the last year","5104":"The JAAC had modelled its approach after the Awami Action Committee (AAC) of Gilgit-Baltistan, which has been active in ensuring the fulfilment of several local demands in recent years","5105":"Earlier this year, the AAC had secured a similar deal with the government for a wheat subsidy","5106":"Initially reluctant, the government seems to have conceded in both cases due to the strategic and economic significance of both GB and Azad Kashmir, particularly with respect to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor","5107":"These regions have historically benefited from tax and customs duty exemptions, widespread subsidies, and certain legal exemptions","5108":"There are many in Islamabad who have long voiced concerns that the exemptions given to the people of these areas have been draining Pakistan\u2019s economy","5109":"While concessionary policies may have benefited the elites in these regions, ordinary citizens have continued to struggle, and they rightly attribute their plight to the power elite","5110":"The people\u2019s reaction to the government\u2019s plans to introduce new taxation measures in former Fata and Pata is yet to be seen","5111":"It is uncertain how the government will react if mass movements akin to AAC and JAAC emerge: will it fold again in the face of adversity","5112":"The IMF\u2019s primary concern is that state institutions do not have a strategy to address the socio-political crisis","5113":"They either resort to extreme and violent measures or complete surrender","5114":"Such measures damage the state\u2019s ability to implement long-term structural reforms in the economic sector","5115":"The IMF assesses the government\u2019s capacity to implement stringent economic measures in a volatile environment, noting that a weak government is less capable of handling such challenges","5116":"The dilemma for state institutions lies in the fairness and constitutional validity of the public\u2019s demands, which are organic and devoid of significant political ambitions","5117":"The JAAC and AAC represent anti-elite movements challenging the existing political order","5118":"These movements, unlike the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement in KP and the Haq do Tehreek in Balochistan\u2019s Makran region, have so far avoided ethnic and nationalistic undertones","5119":"However, this could change if the government fails to fulfil its commitments","5120":"The government needs to navigate a delicate balance between satisfying the masses and meeting IMF requirements","5121":"The only sustainable solution is a comprehensive, long-term plan for socio-economic transformation \u2014 a task the power elite struggles to conceive, as it prefers firefighting and short-term crisis management","5122":"The populist movements discussed here have arisen mainly in peripheral regions, which are fighting for constitutional status or integration into the mainstream administrative system","5123":"For example, Gilgit-Baltistan has long demanded full provincial status, which was nearly achieved under Imran Khan\u2019s government","5124":"But plans were inexplicably stalled and have not been discussed again","5125":"Even though the state was finally able to \u2018mainstream\u2019 Fata after 75 years, it remains an ongoing challenge exacerbated by the increased securitisation of the region in recent years","5126":"Perhaps, instead of clamping down more tightly on both Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir when populist movements broke out, the state should have learnt from its mistakes in Fata and taken a more considered approach","5127":"Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir require mainstreaming in governance, economy and politics, and equal constitutional rights","5128":"Granting these rights could help legitimise and simplify the introduction of the tax reforms that the government envisages for these regions","5129":"However, the unstructured and unplanned handling of social

three-match series 1-1","5160":"The way Azam Khan\u2019s three sixes off fast bowler Mark Adair sealed the match signified Pakistan\u2019s batting approach in the high-scoring game","5161":"The tourists experienced early jolts losing opener Saim Ayub (six) and captain Babar Azam (nought) by the end of the second over","5162":"After hitting paceman Mark Adair for his typical six over square leg on the second ball of the Pakistan innings, Saim atte\u00admpted a pull on the very next delivery but was superbly caught by an airborne Curtis Campher at short midwicket","5163":"A tentative-looking Babar started with three consecutive dot balls and was eventually caught on the very next ball by wicket-keeper Lorcan Tucker off pacer Graham Hume in the second over as the skipper faltered in opening his account by playing an out-swinger through the on-side","5164":"With Pakistan in trouble at 13-2, Rizwan adopted an attacking approach lifting Adair for a six over long-off in the third over before dispatching Hume for a six \u2014 an unusual maximum over third man \u2014 and a familiar sweep for four in the next over","5165":"Fakhar Zaman showed his muscle hitting pacer Craig Young for a six over square leg in the fifth over in which the bowler was also hit for a four by Rizwan","5166":"Pakistan crossed the 50-mark in 5","5167":"3 overs when Fakhar cracked a six off fast bowler Campher","5168":"Rizwan got a life in the same over when he was dropped at 31 by Hume who could not hold on to a high ball at mid-wicket","5169":"Pakistan ended the powerplay at 57-2","5170":"After accelerating with another maximum in the seventh over bowled by Young, left-handed Fakhar was dropped at fine leg \u2014 again by Hume","5171":"The batter was on 26 at the time","5172":"Rizwan collected a boundary in the same over","5173":"Pakistan posted 87-2 at halfway stage as leg-spinner Ben White\u2019s introduction slowed down the run-rate","5174":"Continuing with his customary aggressive batting, Fakhar struck Campher for back-to-back fours in the 11th over during which Paki\u00adstan completed their 100 runs","5175":"Rizwan smacked White for a six over mid-wicket to reach the half-century mark off 34 balls and backed it up with a four in the 12th over as the partnership reached century mark","5176":"The 13th over delivered by Young yielded 21 runs \u2014 most productive for Pakistan \u2014 as Fakhar raced to his 11th T20 International fifty off 31 balls with a six, and added another maximum and a four in the same over during which Rizwan also contributed a boundary","5177":"After hitting White for a four and a six in the 15th over, Fakhar tried another lofted shot but was caught magnificently by Gareth Delany at deep wicket","5178":"Fakhar\u2019s 40-ball 78 featured six fours and as many sixes","5179":"Rizwan struck the spinner for a maximum in the same over that fetched 18 runs","5180":"Azam (30 not out off 10, four sixes) maintained the momentum embraced during the 140-run stand between Fakhar and Riz\u00adwan (75 not out) who faced 56 balls and struck six fours and four sixes","5181":"Earlier after being put in to bat, Tucker and company helped Ireland pile up a fighting total","5182":"Opener Andy Balbirnie started the proceedings productively sma\u00ads\u00adhing two fours in the first over bowled by fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi and followed it up with a stylish four off Naseem Shah through third man in the fourth over","5183":"Captain Paul Stirling in the second over struck a couple of fours off paceman Mohammad Amir, who replaced Shadab Khan for the game","5184":"But Shaheen made a double strike in the fourth over removing both the openers","5185":"The left-armer first dismissed Stirling (11) who attempted a lofted shot but was caught brilliantly by a running Amir at deep mid-on","5186":"The bowler then sent dangerous-looking Balbirnie, who made a match-winning 77 in the series opener, back to the pavilion as the batter was caught by Fakhar Zaman at deep square leg","5187":"The right-hander made 16 off 14","5188":"Naseem in the fifth over trapped Harry Tector right in front off a no-ball as the bowler overstepped","5189":"The batter came back strongly cracking back-to-back fours in the same over","5190":"Ireland ended the powerplay at 55-2","5191":"Abbas conceded 13 runs in the seventh over as wicket-keeper\/batter Lorcan Tucker lifted the right-armer over square leg for a well-timed six and then edged in the same over for four","5192":"The introduction of spin from both ends with Imad Wasim coming in to bowl in the eighth over followed by Saim\u2019s occasional off-spin put some breaks on the scoring rate as Ireland inched to 84-2 in 10 overs","5193":"However, both the spinners were replaced as Abbas gave Paki\u00adstan a much-needed breakthrough in the 12th over sending back Tec\u00adtor (32 off 28, four fours), caught nicely at widish long-on by Shaheen","5194":"Tucker kept the scoreboard moving as the right-hander swept Imad for a six in the 13th over after Ireland reached the 100-mark in the same over","5195":"Shaheen proved extremely costly in the 15th over, conceding 21 runs as Campher thumped him for two sixes and as many fours","5196":"In the very next over however, Campher was dismissed caught and bowled by Amir as Ireland were now 137-4","5197":"The batter struck a quickfire 22 off 13","5198":"Incoming batter George Dockrell struck Amir for a couple of fours in the same over","5199":"Tucker completed his half-century off 32 balls in the 17th over bowled by Naseem who was beautifully struck for a four by Dockrell through the off-side as Ireland brought up their 150 in 16","5200":"3 overs","5201":"However, Naseem had the last laugh against Dockrell as the express pacer induced an edge to wicket-keeper Azam Khan","5202":"The batter played an eight-ball cameo of 15","5203":"Tucker\u2019s gritty knock of 51 off 34 balls \u2014 featuring five fours and two sixes \u2014 finally came to end in the 18th over when he was caught by Fakhar off Abbas at extra cover and the hosts were now 154-6","5204":"New batter Mark Adair smashed the same bowler for back-to-back fours as Ireland looked to push towards a fighting total","5205":"Though Adair (nine) was cleaned up by Shaheen in the penultimate over with a classic yorker which reduced Ireland to 165-7, the bowler was hit for a six and a four by Gareth Delany","5206":"Delany (28 not out off 10) enabled Ireland to finish the innings strongly as they plundered 17 runs off the final over bowled by Amir who was walloped for a six and a couple of fours by the batter","5207":"Shaheen took three wickets but gave away 49 runs while Amir (1-44) and Naseem (1-36) also loo\u00adk\u00aded pretty flat","5208":"Abbas (2-33) and Imad (0-21 in three overs) proved relatively economical","5209":"SCOREBOARDIRELAND:A","5210":"Balbirnie c Fakhar b

had denied 77 reserved seats to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) and distributed the seats to other political parties in the assemblies instead","5223":"The order of the Supreme Court bench resulted in the immediate evaporation of the ruling coalition\u2019s two-thirds majority \u2014 at least for the time being","5224":"The simple majority of the present dispensation at the federal and provincial levels is, however, not threatened even if the final order of the SC allocates the disputed seats to the SIC","5225":"The question of allocation or otherwise of the reserved seats to the SIC in the assemblies is a very important one which has been raised for the first time and will almost certainly require interpretation of the Constitution and Elections Act, 2017","5226":"At the heart of the controversy is the question whether SIC qualifies for the allocation of the reserved seats as do other political parties such as the PML-N, PPP, JUI-F and MQM, which have been allocated the reserved seats since February 22","5227":"What makes the SIC case different from the other parties is that it had not submitted a priority list of its candidates for the two categories of reserved seats (women and minorities) for each assembly before the general election as required by Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017","5228":"SIC candidates for the reserved seats, therefore, did not submit their nomination papers either","5229":"This was the central argument of the ECP when it denied the allocation of reserved seats to SIC in its order of March 1","5230":"The ECP had also ruled that the seats denied to SIC would be distributed among other eligible parties in each assembly since these seats could not be kept vacant indefinitely","5231":"One member of the ECP, however, didn\u2019t agree that these seats could be allocated to other parties","5232":"The SIC challenged the ECP order in Lahore and Peshawar High Courts","5233":"The Peshawar High Court upheld the ECP position in its order of March 14 based on the same argument that the SIC had not fulfilled the requirements of the Elections Act, 2017","5234":"The question of reserved seats will require interpretation of the Constitution and Elections Act, 2017","5235":"Although it has also been argued that the SIC could not be allocated the reserved seats because it did not contest the general election 2024, there is no such provision in the Constitution which bars allocation of reserved seats to a party because it has not contested general election","5236":"Similarly, there is no constitutional or legal provision which bars allocation of reserved seats to a party whose parliamentary party comes into being after the general election when independent candidates join it","5237":"In fact, the case of a party which did not contest election and its parliamentary party emerging in the assemblies after independent members joined it post-general election, becomes stronger for allocation of reserved seats because it is irrational to expect submission of priority list of candidates and their nomination forms from such a party before the general election","5238":"Natural justice, in such case, demands that the newly emerged parliamentary party should be allocated reserved seats in proportion to its directly elected members and it should be allowed to complete the technical formalities such as the priority list of candidates for reserved seats and their nomination forms after the parliamentary party has come into existence","5239":"Now that the case is to be argued before a larger bench of the SC, not only the fate of 77 seats in the national and three provincial assemblies has to be decided, the interpretation of the Constitution (especially Article 51) and the law (Section 104 of the Elections Act, 2017) will also be eagerly awaited","5240":"In addition, the impact of the judgment on some of the important developments that took place in the assemblies while these seats were either vacant or occupied by parties other than the SIC may also be questioned, if SIC gets the reserved seats","5241":"For example, the prime minister\u2019s election took place in the National Assembly on March 3, when reserved seats were not allocated to the parties","5242":"In case SIC is finally allocated the disputed seats, it may raise questions about the validity of the PM\u2019s election","5243":"More important will be the subject of the Senate election which took place on April 9, when these 77 seats were occupied by parties other than SIC","5244":"If the SIC is allocated the seats in the final decision of the SC, the Senate election may be questioned by SIC on stronger grounds as the composition of the Senate would change significantly based on the allocation of seats to SIC","5245":"The validity of Rule 94 of the Election Rules, 2017 may also be questioned in the coming SC proceedings as the explanation at the end of Rule 94 denies the allocation of reserved seats to the parties which do not have an election symbol","5246":"Although the current case is not directly affected by Rule 94, it may be useful to get the court\u2019s interpretation for the future","5247":"Apparently, the election symbol is not relevant in the case of reserved seats and putting this as a condition for qualifying for the reserved seats sounds absurd","5248":"It seems that Rule 94 was considered the main obstacle by PTI when it decided not to form its own parliamentary party in the assemblies after the general election","5249":"Had PTI formed its own parliamentary party by inducting all PTI-supported independent members after the election instead of joining SIC, PTI would have arguably been in a stronger position to claim its share of the reserved seats because it had conformed to the law by submitting the priority list of its candidates and the nomination papers before the election, but these were not accepted by ECP","5250":"The question of election symbol in the rule \u2014 which is at a lower pedestal than the law \u2014 could then be contested by PTI in the courts, probably on a stronger footing","5251":"The writer is the president of Pakistan-based think tank,

importance of protecting the older generations","5534":"The prevalence of informal employment significantly limits the coverage of contributory pension systems","5535":"According to the ADB report, in Pakistan, the working-age population participates in contributory pensions at a mere 7pc, compared to 18pc in Sri Lanka and 15pc in India","5536":"While the reports\u2019 authors Ms Kikkawa and ADB Chief Economist Albert Park acknowledged that there were no easy answers in a country like Pakistan going through a debt crisis to finance large pension programmes, they added that a way to make the pension system more sustainable was to have automatic adjustments to respond to changing economic conditions","5537":"However, one drawback to this system is that a crisis might lead to too low adjustments relative to the population\u2019s needs","5538":"\u201cIt is about smart design and making smart investments,\u201d said Mr Park, alluding to the need for a contributory pension system","5539":"Informal sectorPensions are nonexistent in the informal sector, which employs a significant portion of the workforce","5540":"Informal employment of older people has been particularly problematic as 81pc of those aged 60 and above said that their income has been diminished by Covid-19, according to the report","5541":"In agriculture, the share of older workers exceeds a staggering 50pc, says ADB","5542":"Mr Park said technological innovations through digitalisation could help Pakistan\u2019s pension systems, giving India as an example","5543":"The biometric ID in the India Stack, which uses the biometric Aadhaar national ID to link ID, personal authentication, and payments while protecting data privacy, has halved internal fraud and leakage in India\u2019s pension systems","5544":"Such initiatives could be introduced even for Pakistan\u2019s older illiterate rural farmers if a contributory social pension system exists","5545":"However, there are several big \u2018ifs\u2019 attached to increasing pension coverage through technological innovations","5546":"Such applications would only become applicable if the informal sector was part of the formal sector and provided social pensions, which are not currently on the cards","5547":"Pakistan has a relatively low share of older people in the population","5548":"Even by 2050, Pakistan will still have a share of less 10pc of older people (60-year plus), as per the ADB report","5549":"Published in Dawn, May 19th, 2024","5550":"PAKISTAN is not famous for its reading culture","5551":"Few people read books and the publishing industry has never flourished here as in other countries where books sell by the millions","5552":"But we shouldn\u2019t be surprised","5553":"After all, education is also in the doldrums in Pakistan and the co-relationship between the two is obvious","5554":"An ideal solution would be to combine the two by prioritising books, with teaching literacy following much later","5555":"This may sound ridiculous and untenable","5556":"But it is not and those who have experienced the joy of reading from an early age would testify to the feasibility of this approach","5557":"Here is how books, libraries and education can be integrated systematically, not randomly, to make an impact","5558":"My friend of long-standing with whom I have shared an interest in books, education and language, actually outlines a plan","5559":"Considering that \u201creading is the first and vital step for all gain in knowledge\u201d, my friend (she prefers anonymity) says our focus should be on the library","5560":"On the contrary, very few schools have a functioning library with a full-time librarian","5561":"Even in the public discourse on education, the library hardly ever finds a mention","5562":"To \u201ckindle children\u2019s interest in reading\u201d, it is important to introduce them to books as early as possible","5563":"My friend, a children\u2019s book writer of merit herself, describes her \u201cdream library\u201d as one that is spacious, \u201cairy and well-lit\u201d","5564":"It should be comfortably furnished \u2014 even if sparsely \u2014 and ideally with mats, cushions and rugs and appropriately designed tables and chairs","5565":"It must have writing and drawing material, including a white board, markers, pencils and paper, and electronic equipment as is suitable for promoting storytelling","5566":"Books, libraries and education can be integrated systematically","5567":"Books, mostly in a language familiar to children, should be attractively arranged in open-access shelves","5568":"The most essential component should be a child-friendly librarian who has a passion for books","5569":"The walls should be adorned with colourful pictures with some wall space for the students to hang the pictures they draw","5570":"The aim should be to help the child relax by allowing her to browse and draw, without compulsion","5571":"What will a child learn in this library","5572":"She will acquire confidence, agency and the love of books","5573":"In the process, she will also pick up library etiquette which will come naturally to her if the librarian gently demonstrates to the children what is expected of the library user","5574":"The librarian should encourage children to discuss the books they read","5575":"She should also facilitate book-related activities such as famous people being invited to tell their own life stories","5576":"Essay writing, illustrating a text and reviewing books would draw children to the library","5577":"Another feature of her plan pertains to the importance of nourishment for the child","5578":"She strongly suggests that all children in a school should be provided some nourishment, such as milk and a boiled egg every day","5579":"Children are known to have fainted in school as they get no breakfast at home and come to school hungry","5580":"Given the fact that nearly 50pc of Pakistan\u2019s children are malnourished and stunted, the idea of feeding them is an excellent one","5581":"The dream library could have a snack bar attached where the school could offer edibles to the students before they entered the library","5582":"The plan outlined here could be tried on an experimental basis in one school in each province","5583":"The primary classes should have a library period every day that should be free of the rigours of \u2018normal\u2019 schooling","5584":"The results can be assessed a year later to de\u00ad\u00adcide the future of school libraries","5585":"I am confid\u00adent that if tes\u00adt\u00aded in its true spirit this plan should be a gre\u00adat success","5586":"Here are the reasons why I believe it would show pro\u00admising results","5587":"Maria Montessori, whose philosophy on early childhood learning has revolutionised education in many countries, places emphasis on the first six years of a child\u2019s life","5588":"This phase is marked by the mind\u2019s capacity to absorb","5589":"She talks of the unconscious mind acquiring consciousness and memory","5590":"What the child experiences in this period remains in her psyche","5591":"The child\u2019s book experience \u2014 if she has had one \u2014 would shape her passion for reading","5592":"This should spur on the self-directed learning drive every child possesses","5593":"It will stimulate her creativity and self-discovery instinct as well as her curiosity","5594":"Montessori talks of some children learning to read without the teacher\u2019s guidance if she has been given the right exposure","5595":"Here is food for thought for the readers","5596":"A child enticed by a kindly librarian to come to the library she had hitherto shunned, remarked excitedly, \u201cWhat lovely books","5597":"I had always believed all books are like my textbooks and I am bored stiff of them","5598":"\u201d

and other stakeholders in the economy","6035":"\u201cThere is no indication about any big change in the exchange rate, but media reports about a big jump in the greenback\u2019s value in the next fiscal year could puncture the current stability,\u201d said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the inter-bank market","6036":"Currency experts said inflows in the shape of remittances and foreign direct investments improved during the second half of the current fiscal year, FY24","6037":"\u201cThe short-term scenario for the exchange rate is stable since inflows are high and we have sold $400 million to banks in April,\u201d said Zafar Paracha, General Secretary of the Exchange Com\u00adpanies Association of Pakistan","6038":"Fast changing global, region situation may impact PKR\u201cA prediction for long-term stability in the exchange rate is difficult since the global and regional scenes are changing fast amid wars and conflicts,\u201d he said","6039":"He cited the Gaza tragedy, the war in Ukraine and Pakistan\u2019s relations with Afghanistan as factors which can affect exchange rate stability","6040":"According to analysts, the domestic political and economic situation are deciding factors, among others, which determine the exchange rate in the long term","6041":"The country is facing protests from wheat-producing farmers, a political tussle and agitation against the government, standoff on the border with Afghanistan and worsening law and order, particularly in big cities like Karachi and Lahore","6042":"Bankers said the current account deficit had gone down to just $202m during the first 10 months, meaning it could be zero by the end of the next month","6043":"\u201cThis extremely low current account deficit is a source of stability for the exchange

was not open and clear about the new package for Pakistan","6046":"The IMF is insisting on a drastic cut in expenditure and generation of more revenue in FY25","6047":"The lender has also expressed concern about the burgeoning debt servicing, which leaves nothing for the government to spend and forces it to borrow from banks","6048":"During the first 10 months of the current financial year, the government paid Rs5","6049":"5 trillion as mark-up on debts","6050":"Currency experts said forward booking by exporters had brought premiums down for one-, two- and three-month  purchase, contributing to higher liquidity and exchange rate stability","6051":"Market reports suggested that the dollar gained nine paise against the rupee (PKR) in the inter-bank market this week","6052":"It was not a significant gain and proved the PKR\u2019s tenacity","6053":"Published in Dawn, May 19th, 2024","6054":"The Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), Justice Qazi Faez Isa, often goes out of his way to not provide interpretations of constitutional texts","6055":"Interpretation can sometimes distort the intended meaning of the text","6056":"In May 2022, former CJP Umar Atta Bandial interpreted Article 63-A of the constitution to mean that the votes of the members of the parliament\/assemblies cannot be counted if they did not vote along party lines","6057":"At the time of Bandial\u2019s \u2018interpretation\u2019 in 2022, the article prescribed that defecting members could be de-seated post-facto, but their votes were to be counted","6058":"But Justice Bandial, in his verdict, went beyond interpreting an article \u2014 he actually changed its function","6059":"This is akin to rewriting the Constitution","6060":"According to professor of law Randal N M Graham, \u201cA judge\u2019s only goal in the interpretation of statutes is to apply the will of the legislative author","6061":"When carrying out their interpretive task, judges must set aside their own political preferences and disregard their personal ideologies","6062":"Judicial interpreters should be governed by the author of the legislative text, carrying out the will of parliament","6063":"\u201d \n \nSo, Bandial\u2019s verdict was not about what the legislative authors of 63-A had meant","6064":"The verdict was about what 63-A\u00a0ought\u00a0to mean","6065":"Only elected assemblies having legislative authority can change the meaning of a statute","6066":"According to the legal scholar Peter Hogg, \u201cA judge has a great deal of discretion in interpreting the law in the constitution, and the process of interpretation can inevitably remake the constitution in the likeness of the judge","6067":"\u201dRecent judicial activism maintains the precedents set by now-retired populist judges, whose various verdicts badly disturbed the country\u2019s politics, economics and judicial systemAlthough Graham believes this is too bleak a view, he agrees that there is ample empirical evidence to substantiate it","6068":"In Pakistan, this was visible during the long era of \u2018populist\u2019 CJPs","6069":"These included Iftikhar Chaudhry (2009-13), Saqib Nasir (2016-19), Gulzar Ahmad (2019-22) and Bandial (2022-23)","6070":"In his 1996 book\u00a0Overcoming Law, the American legal expert Richard A Posner wrote that a judge\u2019s decisions are sometimes influenced by a desire to become popular","6071":"This was particularly prominent in the conduct of Iftikhar Chaudhry and Saqib Nisar","6072":"The four mentioned judges were also often alleged to have become part of a \u2018popular project\u2019 by the military establishment (ME) to undermine elected governments headed by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)","6073":"The project\u2019s aim was to facilitate the rise of Imran Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)","6074":"These judges took \u2018populist\u2019 stands that included suo moto actions to regulate prices of onions and mangoes and to stop certain privatisation programmes that eventually cost the state billions of rupees","6075":"And they readily heard petitions filed against the PPP and PML-N regimes, even those based on feeble conspiracy theories","6076":"But it was during Nisar\u2019s tenure that the judiciary really began being perceived by anti-PTI parties as becoming fully embedded in the ME\u2019s \u2018Imran Khan project","6077":"\u2019 This perception was also visible during the Bandial tenure even though, by then, the ME had begun to distance itself from the project due to certain disastrous economic and foreign policy blunders made by the Khan regime","6078":"The era of populist CJPs in Pakistan clearly reflects observations made by Posner regarding factors that can influence the verdicts of a judge","6079":"These include: gratitude to the appointing authorities, irritation with or even a desire to undermine a judicial colleague, not wanting to disagree with people one likes, reluctance to offend one\u2019s spouse or close friends, and racial or class solidarity","6080":"All the mentioned CJPs were influenced by some or all of these factors, but let\u2019s focus on Bandial, who was perhaps the last of the judges of the populist era in Pakistan\u2019s judiciary","6081":"He was clearly \u2018irritated\u2019 by Justice Isa and continued to undermine him","6082":"In this, Bandial was toeing the line drawn by the previous ME, which wanted Isa out because he had begun to be seen as a threat to the Khan government and was \u2018too idealistic","6083":"\u2019 The subtext of the latter mainly meant he was too rigidly tied to the Constitution","6084":"Bandial was heavily dependent on \u2018likeminded\u2019 judges to ward off the threat posed by Isa","6085":"Bandial went out of his way to appease colleagues who supported him","6086":"He packed the benches with these judges","6087":"One of Posner\u2019s factors of influence, \u201creluctance to offend one\u2019s spouse or close friends\u201d, is most interesting, suggesting that this is a universal trait in some \u2018biased\u2019 judges","6088":"There is now enough evidence to claim that the families of populist judges had played an emotional role in influencing the judges to tilt their verdicts in favour of Khan and his party","6089":"More interesting, though, seems to be the fact that, even after the Khan project collapsed in April 2022, and after Bandial\u2019s retirement, the larger judiciary has continued to lean towards Khan and his party","6090":"The influence of families could still be a factor","6091":"But what about the judges who weren\u2019t overtly pro-Khan","6092":"Many of them have now decided to favour him","6093":"Khan\u2019s core constituency is made up of the social classes that the judges come from","6094":"Perhaps class sympathy, too, can be a reason for this turn","6095":"The current batch seems to have begun to use cases against Khan and his party members as a way to demonstrate the \u2018independence of the judiciary","6096":"\u2019\u00a0This has excited quite a few court journalists and activist-lawyers, because they perceive this as being the \u2018judiciary\u2019s pushback against the meddlesome ME\u2019 \u2014 an ME that now wants to penalise Khan for various violations and is allegedly trying to influence the judges","6097":"Recently, when six high court judges publicly complained about the ME\u2019s meddling, and some Supreme Court justices began to deliver \u2018pro-people\u2019 lectures in the court, it became clear that the non-populist batch has also begun to play in the sphere of judicial populism","6098":"Verdicts authored by them have smacked of judicial activism","6099":"These verdicts have maintained the precedents set by the now-retired populist judges, whose various verdicts badly disturbed the country\u2019s politics, economics and the judiciary itself","6100":"The recent emergence in this respect is being driven by an ideology that is positing itself as a fight for democracy and judicial independence \u2014 but not necessarily for the supremacy of the Constitution","6101":"The emergence, perhaps purposely, is lurching forward to undermine CJP Isa\u2019s insistence on sticking to a faithful reading of the Constitution, rather than interpreting it on the basis of a particular ideology","6102":"He now finds himself between a rock (ME) and a hard place (a new batch of activist judges)","6103":"Published in Dawn, EOS, May 19th, 2024","6104":"IN all spheres of governance, failures are hidden behind a smokescreen of moral mantras","6105":"Prioritising education, adhering to a single nation and curriculum, and declaring an education emergency are little more than political dupery","6106":"Education \u2014 the backbone of social mobility and advancement \u2014 is not an investment","6107":"And educational reforms are old policies and curricular orientations packaged in novel titles","6108":"A large majority has lost faith in educational governance and management due to archaic instructional practices and an uninspiring and insular environment in schools","6109":"Palpable change requires steady action, implementation mechanisms and amendments through impartial accountability and evaluation","6110":"Changes in regimes, their interests and the social class they resonate with, drive policy actions","6111":"Such initiatives comprise one-size-fits-all, therefore asymmetric, modalities, which are out of step with global trends","6112":"In fact, management, teaching and learning practices in schools, colleges, and universities are worryingly primitive","6113":"Our lawmakers focus only on shallow improvement schemes \u2014 new buildings, more rooms and teachers \u2014 rather than creating modern learning conditions","6114":"Sadly, decades have gone by without even basic assessment and evaluation of schooling parameters","6115":"Political commitment to education will remain invisible without relevant didactic policies formed in collaboration with scholastic and technical cadres","6116":"Moreover, authoritarian decision-making processes that are carried out by the bureaucratic tier result in deprivation among teachers and the rest of the education fraternity","6117":"The solution lies in devolution of power and making education management a purely professional segment","6118":"For instance, field-level educational governance and monitoring should comprise regular visits to schools by higher authorities, verification of syllabus targets, student attendance and maintenance of logbooks","6119":"School managements are empowered and made efficient through certain decisions, such as class duration that does not exceed 30 to 40 minutes with eight classes per day for all subjects","6120":"Reforms are old policies packaged in novel titles","6121":"Perhaps a slight change can be considered: dividing subjects so that four disciplines are taught per week, along with a prolonged class period","6122":"For example, five days of social sciences are followed by natural sciences through the next week","6123":"This can make a difference; it cuts schooling expenses by half, improves class participation, learning outcomes, planning and assessment for teachers","6124":"In addition, our learning skills have been reduced to copying from textbooks and learning by rote","6125":"Teachers engage students by having them copy the matter on the blackboard, whiteboard, or textbook into their notebooks","6126":"Most of the time, while students reproduce text without any understanding of it, teachers keep their focus on rectifying errors in students\u2019 notebooks \u2014 the same matter they copied as opposed to interpreted","6127":"Hence, parents need to be more engaged with their children\u2019s learning habits, and not just daily homework, so that teachers are compelled to establish higher standards of pedagogy","6128":"Eliminating replication and insisting on learning through interaction with teachers, comprehension and using books as references will lessen financial and logistical burdens on teachers, students and parents","6129":"There is no doubt that, in public schools, the capabilities of the teaching force are substandard","6130":"For instance, a teacher who has taught in a primary school for over 10 years was reportedly unable to continue teaching due to the unavailability of syllabus books","6131":"Consequen\u00adtly, experience beco\u00adm\u00ad\u00ades highly suspect given her dependence on tex\u00adtbooks; it shows lack of proficiency in numeracy and poor orientation where the alphabet is concerned","6132":"What we need are schools with the provision to appoint professional development teachers as mentors, who will collaborate with teachers on daily planning and teaching tasks","6133":"This will trim the enormous payments made to NGOs for supporting the education system, including through costly PDT programmes","6134":"While there are plenty of uncomplicated and realistic solutions that can rectify our dilapidated education landscape, the ruling elite prefers its pursuit of power","6135":"The authorities keep up the pretence of their commitment to quality education by relying on superficial initiatives, catering to the privileged class and making \u2018one nation\u2019, \u2018one curriculum\u2019 and \u2018education emergency\u2019 announcements","6136":"We should be concerned about the government\u2019s persistent disregard for a straightforward, productive and achievable approach","6137":"This deliberate indifference creates social inequity and prevents a broader understanding of

River to the Sea, Palestine Will be Free\u201d, and other slogans against the continuing Israeli war in Gaza have echoed through more than 150 campuses in the United States for the last three weeks","6156":"It may be one of the largest protests since the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 1960s, which were led mostly by students at US universities","6157":"This protest movement, which has incorporated students, faculty, staff and other supporters, has been germinating since Israel invaded the Gaza strip in October of last year","6158":"The nationwide simmering anger in cities and universities against the genocidal violence has, over the months, led to many teach-ins, rallies and civic actions by groups such as Peace and Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace","6159":"At  universities across the US, the administrations have reacted with hyper surveillance of student groups and faculty members","6160":"Pro-Palestinian student groups were suspended in places such as Harvard University, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and other colleges","6161":"In the first few weeks of the war, all criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza was deemed \u2018anti-Semitic\u2019 and, in some cases, disciplinary actions were brought against faculty in various universities, including the University of Virginia, Muhlenberg College, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Arizona","6162":"PROTEST ORIGINS AND REPERCUSSIONSThe current series of protests that spread like wildfire across the country started when students set up an encampment at Columbia University\u2019s south lawn the same day \u2014 April 17 \u2014 the university\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, testified to the US Congress","6163":"Shafik was attacked by Republican legislators, who accused her of tolerating \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 on Columbia\u2019s campus by not doing enough to counter those opposing Israel\u2019s war on Gaza","6164":"Her testimony came four months after a similar combative congressional hearing that led to the resignations of the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania","6165":"Perhaps learning her lesson from her colleagues, who had tried to defend freedom of speech on their campuses, Shafiq denounced anti-Semitism, saying it \u201chas no place on our campus","6166":"\u201dThe last few weeks have seen tumult across a large number of universities in the United States and also Europe, as students protest Israel\u2019s genocidal actions in Gaza and demand their educational institutions divest from companies funding Israel\u2019s apartheid against Palestinians","6167":"Do these protests signal a change in Western grassroots sentiment about Palestine and can they make a difference","6168":"The encampments started to be put up on the lawns of Columbia University that very day","6169":"These encampments are temporary communities, consisting of tents and shelters and occupy a particular area as a form of political resistance","6170":"They are like the tents (called shanties) put up during the movement for divestment from South Africa in the 1980s (see companion piece by Hasan Zaidi)","6171":"In solidarity with the tents at Columbia, and despite being constantly threatened by university administrations with disciplinary action, the protests have now spread throughout the country","6172":"Protestors have erected and maintained camps to disrupt \u2018business as usual,\u2019 accusing their administrations of complicity in financing the continuing genocide in Gaza by Israel","6173":"In setting up \u201cliberation libraries\u201d and medical clinics, supplying free food, and encouraging exchange of cross-cultural resistance histories and art, they also envision and enact solidarities crucial in the pursuit of a more egalitarian future","6174":"At Columbia, armed police were used to rout protesting students out of an occupied campus building on May 1 (Hamilton Hall, that was also occupied in 1968 and has, ironically, become part of the university\u2019s lore that celebrates its history in the civil rights movement), and to dismantle the camps","6175":"There were more than 100 arrests on that day","6176":"Similar tactics were used at numerous universities across the US","6177":"For example, on the night of April 30, a pro-Israeli mob of more than 100 attacked the pro-Palestine encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with rods, fireworks and pepper sprays","6178":"Faculty and students in the camp reported that the police arrived after much delay and then did not intervene to stop the mob of attackers for a couple of hours, nor did they provide protection to those barricaded in the tents","6179":"Many were seriously injured","6180":"These various confrontations with the police at universities have led to more than 2,500 arrests (mostly on misdemeanour charges) across the country, and the repercussions against the students may continue over the long term \u2014 suspension, denial of diplomas and degrees, and more serious charges","6181":"These actions have been largely condemned as the curtailment of free speech (an American constitutionally guaranteed right against any government action that may restrict speech) and the principle of academic freedom, which has been strongly defended during the past few months by the American Association of University Professors","6182":"SHIFTING THE MEDIA FOCUS","6183":"This said, there is also a palpable risk","6184":"The legitimate concerns over violence universities and states are unleashing upon their students and citizens may divert focus from the demands of the student protestors themselves","6185":"In this charged atmosphere, the US media has pushed discussions on whether calling for an end to Israel\u2019s aggression can be construed as anti-Semitic, while also discussing the legalities of First Amendment rights and free speech concerns","6186":"These debates, although well meaning, ironically continue to centre the US as the site of political debate and change and, at times, deflect attention from the major catastrophe unfolding in Gaza","6187":"These media representations, at times, may reduce the politics of protest and encampments to an opportunity to reveal the hypocrisy, degeneration, or criticism of America\u2019s domestic politics","6188":"In the process, it undermines the protest organiser\u2019s historical and transnational political orientation","6189":"It may shift focus away from their most central demands of ceasefire, decolonisation and divestment","6190":"Instead, it entraps the discussion, both by those who are for and against the movement, as a form of US exceptionalism","6191":"For example, in recent weeks, when international media reported on mass graves being discovered in Nasser and Al-Shifa hospitals in Gaza, mainstream American media outlets were saturated by protest coverage","6192":"As the beheaded, zip-tied, and decaying bodies of Palestinians were being uncovered in regions repeatedly bombarded using US supplied weapons, the more important question for US primetime television remained whether democratic freedoms and rights that the US prides itself on were under threat, due to either protestors \u2018disrupting\u2019 the educational process or by the police responding to them","6193":"Interestingly, it is a privilege America has historically enjoyed; to maintain its illusory freedom from the violence and oppression that it itself in many cases orchestrates in countries across the world","6194":"This perceived separation, and its underlying rhetoric of exceptionalism, clearly shifts our focus from US complicity in devastating wars to arguments primarily on US political freedoms \u2018at risk","6195":"\u2019However, while the media, politicians and university administrations seek to recreate this narrative of exceptionalism, student protestors have persisted in their efforts to re-centre Palestine as the source of their motivation and subject of their demands","6196":"All distracting questions reporters have posed to protestors in these past weeks are responded to with utmost clarity of political stance and purpose","6197":"The students pivot the conversation back to demands of halting the genocide in Gaza","6198":"Pro-Palestine activists protest outside Columbia University in New York City: the series of protests across the country started when students set up an encampment at Columbia University\u2019s south lawn on April 17 | AFP\nCALLS FOR DIVESTMENTWithin this context, one major demand by student protestors in all locations is to make transparent all university financial holdings and to divest from those companies that assist Israel in its war effort","6199":"This has been succinctly conveyed in the slogan \u201cDisclose, divest: We will not stop","6200":"We will not rest","6201":"\u201dThe demand is linked to the long-term Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, which has been systematically attacked by US politicians, while anti-BDS Laws have been passed by many state legislatures","6202":"For example, in demanding \u201cdivestment from death\u201d by ending contracts with companies supplying the Israel Defence Force\u2019s (IDF) war in Gaza, the student group Palestinian Solidarity Committee at the University of Texas, Austin (a place we know better) has called upon the UT system to sell off its stock in US weapons manufacturers such as the Lockheed Martin Corporation, Raytheon, Northrop Corporation, Boeing, General Dynamics and others that sell arms to the IDF","6203":"Further, the State of Texas has its own investments, which include nearly $100 million in Israeli bonds","6204":"While the student protestors at US universities see the issue of divestment as a practical way to pressure Israel from continuing the war, they are also attacked for being \u2018anti-Semitic\u2019 because these protestors, according to pro-Israel forces in US politics, do not seek divestment from other countries of the world that are also guilty of human rights abuses","6205":"Further, the issue of divestment itself has become complicated due to the very nature of investments in today\u2019s economy","6206":"In the 1980s, at the height of the South Africa campaign, Columbia University, one of the first to respond to student pressure, sold stocks it held in companies such as Coca Cola, Mobil Oil or Ford Motors, for doing business with the apartheid regime","6207":"Today, universities in general do not openly disclose their investments and invest through complicated financial mechanisms","6208":"Brown University, for example, holds more than 90 percent of their funds through outside asset managers who, in turn, invest in general index funds, private equities and hedge funds","6209":"These new forms of holdings make the challenge for the protestors even greater","6210":"Yet they have still succeeded in convincing some universities, such as Brown, to bring the issue to their board to vote on the divestment issue","6211":"Similarly, some universities, such as Northwestern University, Johns Hopkins University, Harvard and the University of Minnesota, have negotiated an arrangement that clears the camps (without violence) while obliging the university to consider the request for divestment from Israel","6212":"In small but sure ways, the movement is gaining traction","6213":"This move toward divestment to pressurise Israel to commit to a ceasefire is also reflected in a shift in contemporary US popular politics","6214":"The strength of the current movement, echoing protests in the US in earlier decades (civil rights, anti-Vietnam War, South African divestment), is also based on coalition building by students who support the Palestinian cause","6215":"Since the 1990s, the broadly connected group Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) has consciously worked with other activists in the environmental movement, with groups against US intervention in Latin America, with those supporting indigenous rights, with critics of the Gulf War, and with civil rights groups defending African American and minority rights","6216":"More specifically, in the past few years, SJP developed a strong working coalition with the Black Lives Matter movement","6217":"THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHTThis solidarity work, which is manifested in more than 200 SJP chapters across the US, now has the support of many such groups during the recent protest","6218":"It is a form of intersectionality that is described by participants as the coming together of a range of political causes, may it be to protect the climate, anti-racism, to critique capitalism or against settler colonialism (indigenous communities)","6219":"Hence, during demonstrations, rallies or encampments, people of different ethnicities, racial heritage, cultures and identity groups have come together to protest the war in Gaza \u2014 they are certainly not monochromatic","6220":"This is a major success of the movement, as it speaks to young people across race, religion, gender identity and class background, those who want to raise their voices for social justice and provide a critique of global power structures that discriminate against the Palestinian people","6221":"Student action continues through the commencement\/graduation ceremonies period, typically organised around this time of the year","6222":"Universities such as Columbia and USC have cancelled university-wide ceremonies fearing student protests","6223":"Other places have increased security and threatened dire actions against those disrupting events","6224":"Some commencement speakers have also withdrawn from their commitment in solidarity with the students","6225":"There have been some protest in almost all places during the ceremonies by pro-Palestinian students, may it be a walk-out from arenas, the unfurling of a Palestinian flag, the raising of slogans, or by their turning their backs on deans or university presidents when they speak","6226":"Eventually, perhaps, various kinds of social pressure, suppression of speech and overt violence may slow the movement","6227":"Furthermore, with summer approaching, many students and faculty may leave campus","6228":"There is also a general fear among the students that discriminatory action may be taken against activists when most eyes are diverted in the middle of the summer months","6229":"As the philosopher Judith Butler reminds us in an exchange on political performances, bodies involved in mass demonstrations experience fatigue, exhaustion and weariness while exposing themselves to police brutality (including exposure to tear gas and rubber bullets) and repression (all of this has been experienced by the students)","6230":"Yet, surely through these negative experiences, certain solidarities are also being formed by the act of sharing, empathy, resilience, kindness and alliance","6231":"A tent in Rafah in the Gaza Strip sprayed with a message of solidarity with pro-Palestine protests at universities: with protests spreading to the UK and Europe, it is clear that an international movement has been triggered | Reuters\nA TRANSFORMATIVE

society in general in a major way, and exposed the underlying violence that these universities, the paragons of free speech and academic freedoms, can unleash and are capable of against their own students and faculty","6232":"An international movement has been triggered, with protests spreading to the UK and Europe, and the question of Palestine linked to Israel\u2019s genocidal ambitions is now part of mainstream discussion in the US, because it can no longer be hidden or censored to the same extent","6233":"In a recent article in the New York Times, Charles Homans and Neil Vigdor reported that there has been an increase in sympathy toward the Palestinian cause in the last decade, from 12 percent sympathetic in 2013 to 27 percent now","6234":"They argue that the shift is reflective of how pro-Palestinian activists have worked to connect the cause to domestic movements in the US, such as Black Lives Matter","6235":"This shift, according to them, is also generational, as those who are 18-29 years old are three times more sympathetic to the Palestinians than those over 65","6236":"How this increasing support translates in the 2024 presidential elections is not very clear","6237":"What is clear, however, is that the US is going through a truly transformative moment, which has major international repercussions","6238":"The intensity of this moment may subside, but the students have surely made people aware of the continued colonial and genocidal policy being practised by Israel, with the support and backing of the US government","6239":"The only way to address this impasse is not by silencing the students but to agree to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and, eventually, through a dignified and just solution of the Palestinian cause","6240":"Shafaq Sohail is a

follow his translations of ancient Greek literature, including Homer\u2019s Odyssey","6269":"That he remained shy of writing and publishing more was perhaps because of his work as an editor and critic, as the latter can be more harsh on themselves compared to other writers","6270":"Saleem ur Rehman\u2019s short stories take their time, like slow creepers, to grow on readers","6271":"One has

collection, The Hippo Girl and Other Stories, Shah Tazrian Ashrafi offers an exploration of the Bangladeshi experience, navigating through war, the stagnant life of modern Dhaka, and challenges of the global Bangladeshi diaspora","6330":"Ashrafi\u2019s narratives delve into the heart of displacement and communal strife, with characters such as Sami and Jhonaki confronting their altered realities and the ghosts of their pasts in profoundly personal ways","6331":"The tales are majorly focused on the themes of grief, isolation and the search for unlikely solace, such as Jhonaki\u2019s bond with hippos after a tragedy, or Bilal\u2019s struggle with societal rejection and bullying due to his physical appearance","6332":"Ashrafi masterfully portrays the intricacies of human and societal connections, making The Hippo Girl and Other Stories a significant literary debut that offers both a mirror and a window into those navigating the peripheries of society","6333":"Through these stories, Ashrafi establishes himself as a new and vital voice, offering narratives rich with cultural nuance and universal truths about the human condition","6334":"The opening story titled \u2018Brother\u2019, revolves around a group of young friends \u2014 Anwar, Rana, Hakim and Hamza \u2014 in Kamalpara, where life is drastically different from their previous home in Rahmatpur, where they once freely roamed around the vast fields","6335":"Now they are confined to a crowded space; they are limited to the mango orchard for recreation and are faced with a daily struggle for basic needs, such as lining up for bland meals, bathing, washing clothes and using a dilapidated toilet","6336":"A debut collection of short stories from Bangladesh marks its author as a notable addition to the vibrant storytellers of the Global SouthThe story is a stark contrast between the harsh realities of their new life and the memories of a more peaceful time back home","6337":"It focuses on how, in pursuit of freedom, the young men have lost it instead","6338":"Violent conflict had forced them to leave Rahmatpur, where they were living in survival mode and were constantly disrupted by instances of communal violence and military threat","6339":"The protagonist, Sami, reminisces about his brother Shafi, reflecting on their differences and memories and yearning for a reunion amidst the chaos and brutality that has consumed them","6340":"This dark tale emphasises the spirit of a community in the face of war and displacement, hoping to return to peace and normalcy","6341":"Moving to the cover story, \u2018The Hippo Girl\u2019 is about Jhonaki who, after the death of her parents in a violent accident, develops an obsession with hippos as a means of coping with her loss","6342":"This obsession begins when she finds solace by falling asleep against a hippo on the same day her parents died","6343":"Her father, unable to sell his crops for seven months due to infertile land and blamed for his poor farming techniques, resorts to killing her mother and then himself","6344":"This trauma, along with financial despair, leeds Jhonaki to withdraw from traditional village life and her peers, spending most of her time with the hippos, particularly a one-eared hippo, who the villagers regard with superstition and fear","6345":"The hippos, thought to have been brought by white men from faraway lands, were like remnants of colonial oppression and treated with caution by the villagers","6346":"But Jhonaki finds comfort among them, all the while becoming increasingly isolated from human interaction","6347":"Her situation worsens when she becomes pregnant, intensifying the village\u2019s curiosity and concern about her wellbeing","6348":"Eventually, she is ostracised, feared and pitied by her community","6349":"The story explores themes of grief, isolation and the search for comfort in the most unexpected places","6350":"Jhonaki\u2019s attachment to the hippos is a powerful metaphor for her disconnection from a community that struggles to understand or accept her way of coping with immense personal tragedy","6351":"The story brims with cultural context, but also maintains its depiction of human suffering and the ways all of us cling to any source of consolation, no matter how unconventional","6352":"Another tale that left me pondering was \u2018Bilal\u2019","6353":"He is born blind in one eye and unusually pale","6354":"He becomes the target of relentless bullying from his classmates, who mock him by calling him names such as \u201cwhite ghost\u201d and \u201chijra\u201d","6355":"The bullying intensifies over time, especially when he cries, which only provides his bullies with further fuel","6356":"The adults in his life, including teachers and even his peers\u2019 parents, also mistreat him, showing disdain and using derogatory language towards him","6357":"Bilal\u2019s school life is fraught with humiliation, including harsh physical punishment from teachers","6358":"His mother, who faces her own battles within the community, can do little to help him","6359":"The only kindness he receives came from Hamid\u2019s mother, who defends him against the community\u2019s backbiting","6360":"As the story unfolds, the cruelty worsens, leading to his withdrawal from school","6361":"He begins a life of hard labour instead, alongside his mother, with a tragic end that leaves his classmates and community guilty and reeling","6362":"Systemic bullying is a very common problem in Pakistani schools and communities as well, and one can easily resonate with this heart-wrenching depiction of how societal disdain can escalate into severe abuse and tragedy","6363":"This story also goes to show how our society mistreats those who are different and the repercussions one may face when people witness abuse but fail to intervene","6364":"\u2018Bilal\u2019 is a blunt reminder of the importance of empathy, kindness and the responsibility of communities to protect and uplift its vulnerable members","6365":"\u2018The Maid in Dhanmondi\u2019 explores themes of cultural identity, social class and personal redemption, through the interactions of Farah and her maid, Naznin","6366":"The narrative style is introspective and descriptive, delving into the complexities of both characters\u2019 emotions and backgrounds","6367":"The characters are developed well, particularly in how Farah navigates her honouring the legacy of her husband Zafar, who was slain in the liberation war of Bangladesh two years prior, connecting with her roots and gaining professional development in Bangladesh, juxtaposed against Naznin\u2019s spontaneous and grounded life experiences","6368":"The story\u2019s themes reveal deep societal critiques and personal transformations","6369":"\u2018Crescent Boat\u2019 is filled with nostalgia, regret and the complexities of familial relationships, as seen through the eyes of Sarfaraz and his granddaughter Shamsie","6370":"One can say that Shah Tazrian Ashrafi\u2019s writing style is evocative, using detailed descriptions to paint a vivid picture of the setting and the characters\u2019 emotions","6371":"The development of Sarfaraz, in particular, is compelling, as he confronts his past mistakes and the consequences of his decisions on his daughter and granddaughter","6372":"The themes of reconciliation, memory and legacy are explored in a nuanced way, inviting readers to reflect on the impact of family dynamics and personal history on one\u2019s identity","6373":"Ashrafi\u2019s collection of short stories takes readers on a journey through various aspects of life in Bangladesh, from times of conflict, migration and identity, to what can now be called contemporary Dhaka, and the diverse challenges faced by Bangladeshis living abroad","6374":"The Hippo Girl and Other Stories can safely be categorised as a new voice from Bangladesh, marking the author as a notable addition to the vibrant storytelling of the Global South","6375":"The reviewer is a content lead at an agency","6376":"She can be reached at

little as $300,\u201d the press release reads","6386":"According to the press release, a recent Kaspersky survey found that 51 per cent of employees surveyed in the Middle East, Turkiye and Africa region said they could tell a deepfake from a real image","6387":"However, in a test, only 25pc could distinguish a real image from an AI-generated one","6388":"\u201cThis puts organisations at risk given how employees are often the primary targets of phishing and other social engineering attacks,\u201d the firm warned","6389":"\u201cDespite the technology for creating high-quality deepfakes not being widely available yet, one of the most likely use cases that will come from this is to generate voices in real-time to impersonate someone,\u201d the press release quoted Hafeez Rehman, technical group manager at Kaspersky, as saying","6390":"Rehman added that deepfakes were not only a threat to businesses, but to individual users as well","6391":"\u201cThey spread misinformation, are used for scams, or to impersonate someone without consent,\u201d he said, stressing that they were a growing cyber threat to be protected from","6392":"The Global Risks Report 2024, released by the World

cheapest rates for radio internet to have ever been offered (3G\/4G LTE Data Plans for as low as $5\/10GB)","6398":"With over 40 million smartphone users, a very healthy chunk of the population is virtually online","6399":"On the one hand, this is indeed a good omen, but on other, it also provides the rotten ones among us with easy and swift access to high speed internet, thus enabling them to carry out their activities with ease and impunity","6400":"And as always, it is largely women who are at the receiving end","6401":"If mobility and other restrictions weren\u2019t enough, online space too, is now gradually becoming a forbidden entity for Pakistani women; in fact, to some extent, it has already","6402":"The modus operandi of the proverbial rotten bunch is pretty basic \u2013 they set up multiple digital identities that allow them to collect personal information, mainly of women, in order to harass them online and in the real world","6403":"A growing grey-to-black market of cheap and accessible software and hardware, furthermore, allows anyone to infiltrate mobile devices and computers, in order to track someone's social movements","6404":"Needless to say, this places people, especially women, at great risk","6405":"Here are the seven of the most efficient practices that a user should follow to a) avoid chances of harassment through the use of personal data, and b) take appropriate counteraction in case of being harassed online","6406":"Never discount the importance of password strength","6407":"Also, enable a two-step verification on all the online platforms that offer this feature (Facebook, Twitter and Gmail do); it serves as a crucial second line of defense in saving your online accounts if the hacker has successfully cracked your password","6408":"As soon as you feel someone has used your account, change the passwords for all your accounts, not just the one that was hacked","6409":"Otherwise, it\u2019s very easy for the hacker to follow a password pattern and get into your other accounts as well","6410":"You can somewhat avoid this by having very different passwords for each account","6411":"Once you have changed the passwords, report the hacking of your account to the relevant site","6412":"If you are unable to get back the control of your account, this will become even more important","6413":"All the larger websites normally do respond swiftly","6414":"After reporting, it may take the site a little time before you get a response","6415":"Try to contact your family and friends to let them know of this occurrence so that they don\u2019t communicate with your hacked account","6416":"It is very Important to inform your family members, including your parents and guardians, of this, especially if you believe things could go awry later on","6417":"Having your family\u2019s confidence before things take the wrong turn is crucial","6418":"If the harassment has turned into blackmailing and the hacker is demanding money or anything else in return of your private data, do not hand over the money","6419":"Do not give in","6420":"There is a high probability that they will try to blackmail you again, and you can never be sure that they have deleted all the copies of your private data","6421":"In case of cyber harassment or blackmailing, report to Federal Investigation Agency\u2019s National Response Centre for Cybercrime","6422":"You will need to give them your details, as the NR3C doesn\u2019t accept anonymous reports for obvious reasons","6423":"This is a must, as you would want to have an official complaint lodged against the criminal","6424":"FIA\u2019s NR3C department is very active and prompt in dealing with such cyber crimes, and will possibly be the best agency that can

victim, it is essential to support the victim of cyber crimes, as most don\u2019t receive support from their family while going through the trauma of cyber harassment","6437":"For the victim: if you cannot take your family in confidence in case of blackmailing, contact your friends or anyone else in your support system","6438":"You will probably find someone who will be able to help you with correct guidance and support","6439":"Family and peers also need to help the victim reach out to the authorities of the university, college, workplace, or any other institution which you think the attacker belongs to","6440":"As victims are usually terrified in these situations, it is important for peers and the family to take charge and report to any official agencies and places where the hacker(s) works at, if known","6441":"In case you need further information or assistance, you can always refer to the Hamara Internet website","6442":"It has a knowledge base on how to deal with online harassment","6443":"Hamara Internet is part of a Pakistani campaign initiated by the Digital Rights Foundation, which aims to protect Pakistani women against cyber harassment and promote a better understanding of using secure internet and mobile technologies","6444":"The lack of support and a belief that they will be unsafe if they speak out, impacts the already small portion of the female Pakistani population that has access to the internet, as families will often try to restrict further access, once these cases are reported","6445":"Access to the internet has become vitally important for women, not just in Pakistan but around the world, as a means of expressing themselves freely, and to also seek out educational and economic opportunities","6446":"To deny or discourage Pakistani women from gaining access to the empowering platform of the internet is something that the country cannot afford","6447":"It is essential that the government and civil society work together to raise awareness about digital security amongst the general populace, with a focus on strengthening the legal support framework against cyber-crime","6448":"However, rather than implementing vaguely-defined legislation with lots of loopholes and room for abuse; and that can see minors as young as 10 years old being prosecuted, the government and civil society must work on massive awareness initiatives and legal remedies that are proactive and provide safety, support and confidence to victims","6449":"The capacity to tackle and solve the problem of cyber-crime and cyber-harassment in all their forms must be built upon strong foundations, if we are to deal with cyber-crimes in their infancy","6450":"For further information on online protection:","6451":"THE

dozen members for the time being, until the Supreme Court\u2019s final verdict","6456":"Legal experts say law is unclear in dealing with the situation in which PTI-backed SIC is seeking reserved seats, and will require SC interpretationHowever, legal experts appro\u00adached by Dawn agree that law is not very clear in dealing with such a situation in which the SIC was seeking reserved seats","6457":"The controversy emerged as the SIC, which did not officially contest the elections, claimed reserved seats based on the support of PTI-backed independents","6458":"However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) withheld the notifications of these 23 reserved seats \u2014 20 for women and three for minorities","6459":"Later, on March 5, the commission distributed these seats to ruling parties, allocating 15 seats reserved for women to PML-N, four to PPP and one to the JUI-F","6460":"It allocated one seat each reserved for the minorities to PML-N, PPP and MQM-P","6461":"Consequently, PML-N became the largest party in the National Assembly with 123 seats, whereas the tallies of PPP and the JUI-F rose to 73 and 11, respectively","6462":"The ECP also issued notifications on the reserved seats for women and minorities in Punjab and KP assemblies on the same day","6463":"PML-N had initially won a total of 75 general seats and was joined by nine independents","6464":"With the allocation of 19 reserved seats for women and four reserved seats for minorities, the number reached 107","6465":"However, after getting the additional seats following the ECP\u2019s March 5 notifications, PML-N\u2019s tally jumped to 123","6466":"What the law saysThe reserved seats are allocated in the National Assembly under Article 51 of the Constitution and in provinces under Article 106","6467":"The relevant law is Section 104 of the Elections Act","6468":"Clause 6(d) of Article 51 says: \u201cMembers to the seats reserved for women which are allocated to a Province under Clause 3 shall be elected in accordance with law through proportional representation system of political parties\u2019 lists of candidates on the basis of total number of general seats secured by each political party from the province concerned in the National Assembly","6469":"\u201dClause 3(c) of Article 106 says that the members who fill seats reserved for women and

basis of the total number of general seats secured by each political party in the provincial assembly\u201d","6470":"Both the constitutional provisions explain that members to the reserved seats will be elected \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d","6471":"The relevant law, i","6472":"e","6473":"Section 104 of the Elections Act, says: \u201cFor the purpose of election to seats reserved for women and non-Muslims in an assembly, the political parties contesting election for such seats shall, within the period fixed by the Commission for submission of nomination papers, file separate lists of their candidates in order of priority for seats reserved for women and non-Muslims with the Commission or, as it may direct, with the Provincial Election Commissioner or other authorised officer of the Commission, who shall forthwith cause such lists to be published for information of the public","6474":"\u201dExperts\u2019 opinionFormer Senate chairman Farooq H","6475":"Naek, who represented PPP before the Peshawar High Court in this particular case, argued that the Elections Act explicitly said the political parties that contested the elections are entitled to submit the list of candidates for the reserved seats","6476":"He said the SIC did not contest in the elections, and even its chairman, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, was an independent candidate","6477":"He pointed out that both the constitutional provisions cited a \u201claw\u201d for reserved seats, which is the Elections Act, and that the SIC did not submit the list within the prescribed timeframe","6478":"He claimed that the reserved seats could never go to the SIC or the Supreme Court may declare the law ultra vires (beyond the scope or in excess of legal power or authority) to the Constitution","6479":"Constitutional expert Mohammad Akram Sheikh said that though the Elections Act provides that only contesting parties could submit the lists for the reserved seats, the Constitution did not say so, and constitutional provisions have an overriding effect on the statute","6480":"Mr Sheikh said the PTI-backed independent candidates contested the elections using different symbols as the Supreme Court deprived the party of its election symbol, \u2018the bat\u2019","6481":"He said this decision by a three-judge Supreme Court bench was per incuriam (through lack of due regard to law) as a 12-member bench of the Supreme Court in 1989 dealt with the PPP election symbol in the \u2018Benazir Bhutto vs Federation of Pakistan\u2019 case","6482":"According to him, people did not vote for independent candidates; they voted for the PTI","6483":"And since the voters expect all the ancillary benefits for the political party they vote for, the PTI could not be deprived of the reserved seats because these were included in the overall election package","6484":"He pointed out that the SIC could be allocated reserved seats as Sub-Section 4 of Section 104 of the Elections Act says: \u201cIf, at any time, the party list is exhausted, the political party may submit a name for any vacancy","6485":"\u201d Advocate Supreme Court Kashif Ali Malik, however, quoted the apex court\u2019s observation that \u201cthis is the case of first impression; therefore, the Supreme Court would examine all the aspects related to the allocation of reserved seats","6486":"\u201dHe said the Constitution did not mention parties \u201ccontested\u201d in the election and only referred to the \u201claw\u201d for the election of reserved seats","6487":"The law said something that was not in the Constitution; therefore","6488":"Published in Dawn, May 13th, 2024","6489":"There was a ten-year-old girl named Mia","6490":"She was a kind and energetic little

Nazia Hasan","6669":"It happened on Monday evening when singer Alycia Dias paid tribute to inspirational women musicians at the ongoing festival organised by the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa)","6670":"For the uninitiated, Alycia is a renowned vocalist who has many a song to her credit sung for television plays as part of their original soundtrack","6671":"She has also appeared in Coke Studio","6672":"She began the concert with Nina Simone\u2019s iconic number \u2018Feeling Good\u2019","6673":"Before each presentation, Alycia gave a brief introduction to the artist whose song she was to perform","6674":"For example, for Simone, she told the audience that the late American singer was associated with the civil rights movement","6675":"Alycia followed it up with one of her well-known TV drama soundtracks, \u2018Dil-i-Muztar\u2019","6676":"The audience was now impressed with her ability to sing in multiple languages","6677":"Things shifted to a groovy gear when the young vocalist introduced one of the biggest cultural figures of modern times, Beyonce","6678":"Her rendition of \u2018Crazy in Love\u2019 compelled a couple of youngsters to sashay in front of the stage and dance like no one was watching","6679":"The gig never looked back from that moment as next up were the two famous tracks by the inimitable Nazia Hasan \u2014 \u2018Boom Boom\u2019 and \u2018Disco

thing about Alycia is that she doesn\u2019t seem to have a favourite genre \u2014 at least didn\u2019t have it on Monday","6682":"The reason one says is that because while she is in touch with her local roots, she also keeps abreast of the contemporary trends in music","6683":"Dua Lipa\u2019s super-hit song \u2018Levitating\u2019 is not easy to cover","6684":"Alycia did it with the kind of

of dozens of people, martyrs and wounded, but no ambulance vehicle can get into the area,\u201d he told Reuters","6699":"The Israeli military said forces have continued to operate in areas across the Gaza Strip, including Jabalia and Rafah, and struck over 70 targets","6700":"Armed wings of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, and Fatah said its fighters attacked Israeli forces in Jabalia and Rafah with anti-tank rockets, mortar bombs, and explosive devices already planted in some of the roads, killing and wounding many soldiers","6701":"At least 35,386 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli

Pakistani Urdu Writing by Amina Yaqin is a comparative study of Urdu literature\u2019s pre- and post-Partition eras","6713":"The author undertakes a comprehensive examination of the various conceptions and representations of gender, sexuality and feminism in Urdu literature during these eras across five chapters, as well as a separate concluding chapter","6714":"Amina Yaqin is currently an Associate Professor of World Literatures and Publishing at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom","6715":"She has researched and written widely on gender, Urdu literary culture, postcolonial theory and Muslim Studies","6716":"Yaqin outlines her overall argument and its scope in the first and introductory chapter","6717":"She also simultaneously contextualises her overall topic in the light of various topics in South Asian Studies","6718":"These cover resistance movements, folk literatures, Sufism, 19th- and 20th-century Muslim upper class cultures, reform movements, women\u2019s education, women writers and the Progressive Writers\u2019 Movement, and post-Partition socio-political climes of Pakistan","6719":"Her introduction could easily function as a literature review","6720":"Therefore, it will prove to be a great asset to any student or scholar of humanities and social sciences working in the realm of South Asian Studies, starting their research on any of these topics","6721":"An academic book providing a comparative look at pre- and post-Partition era writing in Urdu literature is an extremely useful tool for researchersThe next two chapters are mostly presented as context-based overviews of 19th-century Urdu literary texts and women\u2019s writings during the times of the Progressive Writers\u2019 Movement","6722":"However, Yaqin has also selected certain literary texts from both these time periods, which she believes represent their respective eras and also connect with the overall scope of this book","6723":"She has given a textual analysis of each of these texts","6724":"The second chapter is, therefore, a textual analysis of the monumental works of authors such as Nazir Ahmad and Mirza Hadi Ruswa","6725":"Similarly, in the third chapter, she analyses the Urdu poetry written by women poets who wrote under the influence of the tenets of the Progressive Writers\u2019 Movement during the first half of the 20th century","6726":"Like the introductory chapter, the second and third chapters can be potentially useful texts for students and scholars researching on either of these topics","6727":"Similarly, the next two chapters, four and five, form the central focus of this book","6728":"In Chapter Four, Yaqin discusses the life and works of the renowned and much loved Urdu poet Fahmida Riaz, exploring, among other aspects of her work, how Riaz expresses a gendered conception of identity that has been entrenched in the imaginations of both language and culture that transcend the boundaries of the nation in her writings","6729":"Next, in Chapter Five, the author discusses the life and works of Kishwar Naheed, another equally renowned and much loved Urdu poet","6730":"Yaqin analyses how Naheed\u2019s innovative contributions to Urdu poetry has helped her to breach the boundaries of sharafat, respectability and patriotism","6731":"All the earlier chapters, which can be thought as standalone portions of the book, are essentially all contextualising the author\u2019s arguments presented in these two chapters","6732":"For this reason, any student or scholar studying Urdu literature, especially feminist literature, will benefit from reading chapters four and five to a great extent","6733":"Yaqin\u2019s book is remarkable in the sheer clarity of its overall scope","6734":"For instance, its title encapsulates its main topics in a few concise words","6735":"Anyone considering purchasing the book at a local bookshop would immediately grasp what it is about by looking at the title","6736":"Within the book, the author has also consistently maintained this sense of clarity","6737":"One of the ways in which she has achieved this is by peppering the text, at somewhat regular but definitely well-placed intervals, with transition markers that clearly signal where the argument is now headed to","6738":"Yaqin\u2019s book is remarkable in the sheer clarity of

the text, at somewhat regular but definitely well-placed intervals, with transition markers that clearly signal where the argument is now headed to","6743":"This is immensely helpful in directing one\u2019s reading process and maintaining one\u2019s focus while reading","6744":"In fact, this is very extraordinary indeed, because Yaqin\u2019s book covers such a wide variety of topics and analyses so many literary texts that, if it lacked this clarity, it could have resulted in a sub-par reading experience","6745":"Another positive aspect of this comprehensiveness is that it enables researchers to use various sections of Yaqin\u2019s book according to their needs, based on their respective research topics","6746":"For example, someone researching Fahmida Riaz and\/or Kiswhwar Naheed could benefit much from reading those specific chapters","6747":"Similarly, someone researching 19th century Urdu novels and their representation of women and the overall Muslim society of that era might benefit from the second chapter","6748":"Hence, Yaqin\u2019s book is not limited to only gender, sexuality and feminism in Pakistani Urdu literature, but can easily be of much use in various other research topics as well","6749":"Unfortunately, one\u2019s reading experience is adversely affected by terrible copyediting and proofreading errors that are littered throughout the book","6750":"One finds at least one proofreading\/typographical error per page, which interferes with one\u2019s comprehension and understanding of the complex concepts and arguments made by the author","6751":"The editorial team responsible for the book could have been a little more careful","6752":"However, these editorial oversights cannot, and do not, minimise the value of this book","6753":"Yaqin\u2019s latest publication is an important academic contribution to Urdu literary studies, as well as to the South Asian Studies discipline","6754":"It is, primarily, of great interest to an academic readership \u2014 mainly academics, students, and scholars whose research interests lie within the realms of Urdu literature, comparative South Asian literary studies, general South Asia studies, as well as several other disciplines within humanities and social sciences","6755":"That said, since this book is heavily academic, it is likely that most general readers would lack the inclination or interest in buying and reading it","6756":"The reviewer is pursuing an MPhil in English literature","6757":"Her research focuses on various South Asian literary traditions, including Anglophone literatures of South Asia, resistance movements and resistance poetry, as well as Urdu and Sindhi literatures","6758":"X: @sabro20Published in Dawn, Books & Authors, May 12th,

without one","6767":"It was not until a month into this disruption that the government came clean that there was in fact, officially, a ban in place","6768":"However, at the time, Information Minister Atta Tarrar contended there was no notification","6769":"On March 20, 2024, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) submitted a notification issued by a section officer of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to block access to X","6770":"This was in ongoing proceedings before the Sindh High Court (SHC) challenging the restriction on X","6771":"Then on April 17, 2024, the Ministry of Interior (MoI) submitted a response before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in which it cited two reasons for this restriction:Here\u2019s a look at some of the claims made by the MoI in its response submitted to the IHC and how they check out","6772":"According to the MOI\u2019s response to the IHC, \u201cThe decision to impose a ban on Twitter in Pakistan was made in the interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order, and preserving the integrity of our nation","6773":"\u201d Para 13 states: \n\nClearly, no one in the government got the memo since they have all been using VPNs for the last two months to post on X","6774":"Have government departments and government officials \u2014 including the minister heading the MOI making this claim \u2014 knowingly and unknowingly been sabotaging \u201cnational security\u201d, \u201cpublic order\u201d and \u201cintegrity of the nation\u201d through their use of X","6775":"Does their continued use of X despite the ban and admission of reasons following the submission of this response to court, not do so","6776":"How does a platform threaten national security and public order","6777":"How has its ban, yet use via VPNs, prevented this","6778":"What is so secret that has to be presented in a sealed envelope","6779":"Many claims are thrown around but answers to basic questions, there are none","6780":"The timing of the restriction is a little more than a coincidence, coming in the wake of a statement by then Rawalpindi district commissioner \u2014 aired on channels and published in the mainstream press \u2014 on election manipulation, as well as election irregularity accounts rife on X by candidates and parties \u2014 primarily the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), but also the National Democratic Movement","6781":"Curiously, MOI\u2019s response cites \u201cthe failure of X to adhere to lawful directives of the Government of Pakistan and address concerns regarding the misuse of its platform,\u201d which \u201cnecessitated the imposition of a ban\u201d","6782":"Para 12 states: \n\n \n\nDirectives can only be lawful if issued in exercise of lawful authority, which the MOI is devoid of vis-\u00e0-vis online platforms and content","6783":"After the enactment of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (PECA), Section 37 outsources content regulation \u2014 which is really a content censorship regime \u2014 to the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA)","6784":"A public body can only do what it is authorised to do by law","6785":"No law vests any powers in the MOI to undertake the regulation of online platforms or content","6786":"The notification produced before the SHC regarding the restriction of X is signed by a section officer of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)","6787":"Neither the MOI nor the FIA have any authority under Section 37 of PECA; this is vested solely in the PTA, and yet, no PTA notification is on record with respect to the ban on X","6788":"Asked whether the MOI or the federal government can instruct the PTA to block access to a platform or online content, lawyer Zainab Janjua explained: \u201cThe PTA is an independent regulator","6789":"Under the Telecom Act, 1996, the federal government has been given the power to issue policy directives on certain issues such as telecommunication system and services etc; however, the same are only policy directives and are not binding if they are in violation of law or go beyond the policy mandate and amount to usurping the power of PTA\u201d","6790":"Under Section 37(3) of PECA, during the transitory period (till rules were framed) the PTA was directed to exercise powers under PECA in accordance with the directions issued by the federal government","6791":"The IHC in 2018, while discussing Section 37 clearly held that \u201cthe federal government like any other person can lay information before the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority but the same cannot be treated as binding in the context of subsection (1) of section 37","6792":"The Authority is exclusively empowered under subsection (1) of section 37 of the Act of 2016 to consider any information laid before it and then to decide whether or not to take action in the manner prescribed therein\u201d","6793":"The court further held that the PTA is required to exercise its powers and discretion under Section 37 independently and without being influenced by direction or information laid before it by the federal government","6794":"\u201cIn view of this very clear judgment of the IHC,\u201d said Zainab, \u201cthe position of the PTA and MOI before the IHC today that establishes that X was blocked merely upon the directions of the MOI, is blatantly in violation of the law and the court\u2019s directives","6795":"\u201dNeither the PTA nor the federal government can feign ignorance as they were respondents in the case and are well aware of the court\u2019s orders","6796":"The government\u2019s directives aren\u2019t so lawful after all \u2014 they should, at the very least, first review their own conduct before instructing companies and citizens to follow the very law they are themselves flouting","6797":"To further advance the justification for the ban on X, the MOI has relied on the RBUOC Rules 2021","6798":"These rules were introduced by the PTI government first in 2020, then via an amended version which was gazetted in 2021 amid stiff opposition by rights and pressure groups","6799":"The rules, as intended under the scheme of 37(2), were supposed to prescribe an oversight mechanism for the exercise of powers by the PTA to keep it in check; instead, they give additional powers to the PTA which even the Act does not authorise","6800":"The compliance requirements cited in Rule 7(5) is one such example of the rule and powers being in excess of the parent law and provision \u2014 Section 37 of PECA","6801":"The vires of the rules were challenged through various petitions filed before the IHC","6802":"Clubbed together, in Muhammad Ashfaq Jutt Versus Federation of Pakistan, etc","6803":"(W","6804":"P","6805":"No","6806":"3028\/2020), order dated 11","6807":"05","6808":"2022, the IHC observed: \n\nNot only has no such review taken place, but rules referred to as \u201cprima facie in violation of Article 19\u201d are being invoked and used as a legal basis for blocking X for non-compliance with them, while the challenge to these remains pending","6809":"Rules challenged on the basis of their lack of legal validity and unconstitutionality are being cited as a legal justification for the restriction on X","6810":"Telling is the MOI\u2019s response, about what the restriction on X is actually about \u2014 localisation","6811":"Para 11 states: \n\nGetting companies to incorporate locally to conform to local laws and rules has been a longstanding demand and attempt by successive governments","6812":"With a legal and physical presence, coercion and forcing compliance becomes much easier","6813":"But companies do not establish local domains and especially offices because a government wants them to, particularly in a volatile environment where no legal or regulatory certainty exists and the risk of extra-legal measures, including threats to the safety of their staff, runs high","6814":"Even at the time of the YouTube ban, this was Google\u2019s response on localisation: \n\nIn the absence of legal presence in a country, local laws do not apply","6815":"The only route for such requests is either through community guidelines or the government requests channel which has a prescribed process and is subject to internal due diligence processes which vary from company to company \u2014 not local laws where platforms are accessible but not incorporated","6816":"Notice-and-takedown systems require at the very least, a notice","6817":"Such notices must specify offending content, which means the URL\/URI, the category it falls under, relevant section of law or requisite court order accompanying the request, and reasons for its restriction or removal","6818":"Google\u2019s response at the time of the YouTube ban outlined this: \n\nThese cannot be secret notices and companies too have a disclosure obligation, especially when there is compliance with a government request","6819":"This was witnessed recently when X restricted certain posts in India, where the exact requests were publicly disclosed in the interest of transparency","6820":"Notices cannot be non-existent or concealed","6821":"Lawful notifications have to be with requisite legal authority as well as specific and reasoned \u2014 the notification to restrict X produced before the SHC and IHC meets none of these tests","6822":"Apart from being unconstitutional and an overbroad restriction, blanket bans are a tactic to collectively punish all users to force companies to come to the table and meet the government\u2019s demands by keeping their platform hostage and inaccessible, indefinitely","6823":"For the first time in two months since the restriction on X, the company has spoken","6824":"Through its Global Government Affairs account, X posted: \u201cWe continue to work with the Pakistani Government to understand their concerns","6825":"\u201d \n\nWhat concerns are these that are not present in responses submitted to court nor any other official notification","6826":"That companies and governments have backchannels is known to all","6827":"The ones who are disenfranchised through this process are users and rights advocates fighting the long and hard battle of rights","6828":"When YouTube was banned, the unconstitutionality and legality of the ban was called into question","6829":"While a court challenge was underway, and debates ensued in parliament and the public, Google launched a ","6830":"pk domain after which the government unblocked the platform","6831":"YouTube remained banned for three years","6832":"Despite court challenges, resolutions in Parliament to lift the ban, it was only when Google launched a ","6833":"pk domain and content requests were acceded to at the country-level, that the platform was unblocked","6834":"While access to YouTube was restored, the issue of unconstitutional and illegal government action was not, which persists to this day","6835":"Similarly, TikTok has been blocked multiple times","6836":"In 2020, the ban was challenged before the IHC, but it was only lifted by the PTA after there were assurances by TikTok of compliance with requests; the compliance rate as recorded in TikTok\u2019s transparency report, has surged over the years","6837":"Requests received by TikTok from governments across the world over the years","6838":"\u2014 Screen Grab via TikTok transparency report\nIt appears the same tactics are being used now with X as is evident through the MOI\u2019s response, to at least force compliance at the country level, if not global","6839":"It\u2019s the age of an Internet with borders, where users are sandwiched between coercive government action and company compliance","6840":"The oft-taken line is: but this happens elsewhere too","6841":"Recently, examples of proposals to ban TikTok in the United States (US) have been referenced, most recently by the foreign minister","6842":"Such legislative proposals are squarely being opposed by rights advocates in the US","6843":"What has been framed as a data ownership and national security issue, is also a free speech and access to platform issue as put into perspective by rights advocates there","6844":"The specifics of every situation must be considered","6845":"Moreover, important is the discourse by local rights advocates and what their take on the issue is rather than citing government action as a justification; by this measure, will the Pakistan government also cite and support the suspension of Internet services in India-occupied Kashmir or a communication services blackout in Gaza by Israel, or the shadowbanning of pro-Palestine voices on social media platforms","6846":"There is no need to emulate what is problematic or go several steps in a direction to outdo the bad instead of doing better","6847":"Awareness of the critique as well as the challenges brought by citizens and companies against such government action elsewhere is important to keep sight of","6848":"Moreover, consequences of compliance with local laws, especially in election contexts, should serve as a warning, especially in election and politically volatile contexts as witnessed in various countries","6849":"Various users in Pakistan routinely receive emails from X, saying their content was reported as a violation of local law but no action was taken","6850":"Depending on how \u201cconcerns\u201d are addressed between the government and X, this could soon go in the direction of Turkey or India, where requests are acceded to even if there is \u201cdisagreement\u201d","6851":"The answer to everything is not blocking","6852":"Blanket bans on platforms exacerbate disinformation, which needs to be countered with accurate information","6853":"Contrary to claims that the prevalence of disinformation necessitated the restriction on X, blocking platforms spreads more disinformation as channels to verify information become unavailable","6854":"Fact-checking organisations are also facing problems in engagement and reach","6855":"This is actually contributing to disinformation and misinformation out there and thwarting the work of organisations and the mechanisms in place to combat them","6856":"According to Benazir Shah, editor at Geo Fact Check: \u201cThe official blocking of X (Twitter) has made it difficult for fact checkers to track disinformation and misinformation online in real time","6857":"Firstly, fact checkers are now forced to purchase VPNs to access X, where most politically-related disinformation circulates","6858":"Secondly, the suspension of X also prevents fact checkers from accessing official information from government sources which in some cases is essential to determine the accuracy of a claim","6859":"Rather than assisting fact checkers and journalists in verifying claims, by providing easy access to official documents, records and information, the government has chosen to ban a platform which is a vital source of information","6860":"Government officials further use disinformation as an excuse to justify censorship in the country","6861":"\u201dRequests recorded in Google\u2019s transparency report are revealing","6862":"What is passed off as a violation of local law is actually an attempt to censor political content and speech","6863":"The infographic shows reasons for requests for removal of content made by the Government of Pakistan to Google since 2011","6864":"\u2014 Screen grab via Google Transparency Report\n \n\nTable shows reasons for requests for removal of content made by the Government of Pakistan to Google since 2011","6865":"\u2014 Screen grab via Google Transparency Report\nClearly recorded is non-compliance with these requests","6866":"Yet, Google and its services remain accessible in Pakistan","6867":"Other platforms also have not incorporated, or set up offices in Pakistan, yet they remain operational","6868":"The selectivity and timing of the restriction on X, which has fewer users compared to other platforms but far more political relevance and reach globally, exposes the actual reasons behind its restriction","6869":"When PTI was in government, it built up Digital Pakistan as a brand and yet introduced the draconian social media rules despite criticism","6870":"These rules are now being used to justify blanket bans on platforms such as X, and

considerably","6888":"Normally, fruit pulp-making units approach orchard owners and exporters a couple of months before fruit harvesting and sign an informal contract to lift fruit supplies that do

towards urban centres","6898":"\u201cOnly value addition can save the national economy","6899":"Otherwise, we will remain a raw material producing nation, always relying on other countries for processed, finished goods,\u201d Mr Rehman says","6900":"Due to the levy of 10pc Federal Excise Duty (FED) in the 2022-23 budget, industry sales plummeted to Rs43 billion, which would have increased to more than Rs70bn, considering the industry\u2019s growth trajectory in the previous years","6901":"In the 2023-24 budget, the government raised the FED to 20pc to meet revenue shortfalls","6902":"However, this has proved counterproductive, with no gains for the national exchequer due to dipping sales and volumes","6903":"It has also opened the field for mushroom growth of the tax-evading undocumented sector due to cheap, low-quality, and possibly unsafe products, while adversely affecting the rural economy of fruit farmers who are associated with this value chain","6904":"According to industry representatives, the imposition of 20pc FED has shot their sales down by around 50-70pc, slashing their new procurement targets","6905":"\u201cWe are carrying inventory from the last year due to the dip in sales in the wake of our products becoming costlier since the imposition of 20pc FED disallowing us to consume our previous stocks,\u201d says Zulfikar Gondal, the chief executive officer of one of the major brands of fruit juices","6906":"\u201cGiven our inventory, current sales trends and other factors, at least mangoes may not be purchased this season, and there shall be a substantial drop in the procurement of peaches, apples and other fruits","6907":"\u201dA shrinking business size has created more unemployment within the industry","6908":"After the imposition of the FED, the industry has not been utilising its full production capacity","6909":"As a result, no new investments were made in 2023-24 and aren\u2019t planned for 2024-25 either","6910":"After the imposition of the 20pc FED, industry volumes have crashed by 41pc, and fruit procurement has gone down by almost half","6911":"This has affected pulp

and many players are considering downsizing their sales and production teams to cut down expenses,\u201d says the general manager of another unit, who is requesting not to be named","6914":"As the drop in sales has led to a shortfall in the revenue the government expected to collect, he wonders what the government achieved in this trade-off","6915":"Fruits have a high wastage rate because of their intrinsic perishability and improper handling, storage, packaging and transportation","6916":"This causes farmers to sell their produce very low prices, especially during peak season","6917":"A Fruit Juice Council spokesperson says the formal packaged juice industry prevents significant food wastage and protects farmers\u2019 livelihoods","6918":"The industry has also been helping farmers adopt best practices, which has resulted in uplifting farmers\u2019 development, she claims, requesting not to be named","6919":"She advises the government that Pakistan should follow progressive taxation, like other countries that offer preferential tax treatment to packed fruit juices","6920":"This is because packed fruit juices contain natural fruit, which makes them healthier","6921":"\u201cThe government should focus on allowing the formal industry to flourish by at least bringing down the FED rate","6922":"18pc GST [general sales tax] already exists in the category","6923":"Contrary to it, there is no cess on juices in India, where pure fruit juices have only 12pc GST","6924":"\u201dThe packaged fruit juice industry also has great potential for exports, as our fruits are highly demanded worldwide","6925":"However, to realise that potential, we need a strong base and presence in the local market","6926":"That\u2019s what will attract new technology and investment and spur exports","6927":"If the last year has shown anything, she argues, it is that the FED has made the formal juice business unviable, and this is a cause for alarm for economic growth, particularly in the rural economy","6928":"Only the documented sector pays these double taxes","6929":"\u201cConsumers conscious of the high prices have been buying products manufactured by

of about Rs4 trillion in FY25 for power companies","6947":"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has called a public hearing on May 23 to examine a petition filed by the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the Power Division on behalf of power companies seeking an increase of Rs4","6948":"40 to Rs6","6949":"51 per unit in the overall power purchase price (PPP) for FY25","6950":"The CPPA, acting as a commercial agent of the power sector, has presented seven different scenarios for electricity to be sold during FY25","6951":"Under these estimates, 131,000 to 139,000 gigawatt hours (GwH) of electricity sales are expected next year, with demand growth ranging from 3pc to 5pc","6952":"The minimum increase under one estimate works out to be Rs4","6953":"40 per unit in PPP and goes up to Rs6","6954":"50 per unit to Rs27","6955":"11 per unit","6956":"On average, the CPPA has sought an increase of Rs6","6957":"80 per unit in PPP or more than 25pc based on the annual revenue requirement of about Rs3","6958":"6tr or an average PPP rate of Rs32","6959":"75 per unit when compared to Rs26 per unit (Rs2","6960":"87tr) in the current year","6961":"After additional distribution margins of about Rs385 billion for Discos and about Rs80bn of prior-year adjustments, the average sale rate for next year works out to be Rs37 per unit based on Rs4","6962":"07tr against Rs29","6963":"78 per unit or Rs3","6964":"3tr for the current year, representing an increase of 25pc","6965":"The major increase of almost 50pc has been sought on account of

been considered for transmission, use of service charge, market operation fee, and distribution margin etc","6981":"For the current fiscal year, the base power purchase price approved by the Nepra

different sectoral entities and relevant platforms","6988":"Published in Dawn, May 16th, 2024","6989":"AN equitable and fair tax system is crucial for boosting investment and growth","6990":"In Pakistan, however, the sole purpose of tax policy is to collect revenues, even if it is at the cost of existing and future investments and economic growth","6991":"Consequently, we see the proliferation of regressive indirect taxes, some of which are economically harmful because of their negative effects across the value chains of particular industries","6992":"One such example is the case of federal excise duty (FED) on the packaged fruit juice industry","6993":"It is interesting to note that the government raised the FED rate on the fruit juice industry to a whopping 20 per cent in the current year\u2019s budget despite empirical evidence about the levy\u2019s adverse impacts on the industry\u2019s entire value chain in terms of drop in sale volumes and revenues of the juice producers, loss in government tax collection owing to falling sales, reduced fruit purchases from farmers, and \u2014 last but not least \u2014 induction of cheaper but far less healthy alternatives in the market by the informal, undocumented sector","6994":"This lack of predictability and policy consistency has also compelled many looking to invest their capital in the supply chain to put their investment decisions on hold","6995":"The packaged fruit juice industry experienced a 45pc plunge in sales in March and April last year after the enhanced FED was imposedThe industry reported a drop of almost 23pc in sales from Rs53","6996":"3 billion to Rs41","6997":"2bn in one year due to a retail price increase in the wake of a 5pc FED imposition in the fiscal year 2018-2019","6998":"After the FED was removed, the industry grew for three years","6999":"As a result, in FY22, the industry had an annual turnover of nearly Rs62bn and locally purchased an estimated 100,000 tonnes of mango, kinnow, apple, peach and guava from farmers for pulp conversion","7000":"The general sales tax (GST) collection again rose and almost fully covered the loss from FED removal","7001":"Based on the pace of recovery, the industry sales were projected to grow to more than Rs71bn in FY23","7002":"However, the levy was re-imposed at a higher rate of 10pc through a supplementary finance bill in February 2023 to collect additional tax revenues to meet one of the conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the hopes of reviving the suspended loan agreement","7003":"The industry experienced a 45pc plunge in volumetric sales in the following two months, March and April","7004":"The evidence shows that the drop in sales was directly linked to the implementation of the enhanced FED","7005":"Nonetheless, that did not stop the tax authorities from doubling the FED rate to 20pc instead of withdrawing it when the levy was again imposed on fruit juices, nectars and juice drinks to meet the IMF-mandated revenue goal in the budget for the present year","7006":"Consequently, the tax-compliant juice producers have witnessed their volumes plunge by 41pc, with sale revenues plummeting to Rs49bn in FY24","7007":"The juice industry\u2019s curtailed revenues compared to the earlier revenue growth forecast of Rs71bn","7008":"However, that revenue growth projection was made on the back of growth experienced by the industry before the tax authorities decided to juice it through the regressive levy at a very high rate","7009":"The shrinking business size has had and will continue to have an unfavourable impact on the government\u2019s sales tax revenue across the supply chain, negatively impacting fruit farmers and pulp processors","7010":"Reduced sale volumes and revenues have also led to job losses across the value chain and dented the incomes of fruit farmers","7011":"The industry is not fully utilising its installed production capacity due to a sharp contraction in demand for higher retail juice prices","7012":"No wonder no new investment was made during the present fiscal year and no plans are planned for the next year, either","7013":"Some companies have even let go of workers to save costs due to plummeting sales","7014":"The fruit pulp purchases are also declining proportionate to the recent plunge in the volumetric sales","7015":"At its peak, the formal juice industry was procuring more than 100,000 tons of fruits \u2014 mangoes, peaches, oranges, bananas, guava, etc \u2014 from farmers, which had helped them significantly curtail their post-harvest crop wastage that used to be in the range of 30-40pc","7016":"With consumers effectively paying around 42pc of the price as taxes, including 18pc sales tax, on a pack of juice, the regressive levy is fast pushing inflation-stricken consumers away from healthier but more expensive juice options to the low-priced and low-quality alternatives being marketed by the undocumented sector","7017":"It mustn\u2019t be surprising that the undocumented juice producers have increased their market share to 20pc of the industry size and are minting huge profits, without paying any taxes, from low-quality products","7018":"The impact of FED has also proven to be counterproductive, with no gains for the national exchequer owing to sinking sales and volumes","7019":"The formal packaged juice industry has shown great potential for increasing exports","7020":"Currently, packaged juices are exported to more than 30 countries worldwide, with the potential to increase shipments","7021":"However, exports will suffer if the industry fails to get back on the growth trajectory","7022":"Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, May 13th, 2024","7023":"The

integrated general sales tax (GST) from the Inter\u00adnational Monetary Fund to achieve the true spirit and benefits of the value-added tax (VAT) for documentation and digitisation","7193":"Sources told Dawn that carbon tax was one of the measures being deliberated that could also help garner international financial support for newer aid instruments, including green and e-bonds and cheaper loans and grants from multilateral institutions","7194":"The future development programme is already being aligned with climate public investment management benchmarks, the sources added","7195":"The IMF was advocating a revival of standard GST on petroleum products in addition to up to Rs60\/litre petroleum levy as one of its broader programme objectives to transform the existing GST scheme with a universal VAT mode of taxation on consumption across the economy with no exception or preferential treatment to any sector","7196":"The authorities, however, suggested the re-introduction of the carbon tax or increasing the threshold for petroleum levy in the coming budget to as much as Rs100\/litre for greater revenue generation from petroleum products because its proceeds stay fully in the federal kitty, unlike the GST that overwhelmingly goes to the provinces","7197":"According to sources, the carbon tax was a beneficial initiative for international support and to earn carbon credits and cheaper finances and could then be dedicated to environment-friendly expenditures that replace carbon-emitting practices and contain greenhouse gas emissions","7198":"The two non-tax revenues (petroleum levy and carbon tax) would be in place simultaneously in case of a final decision","7199":"The officials argued that federal revenue instruments, like petroleum levy and carbon tax, were easier to collect and address financial constraints than rebalancing the National Finance Commission (NFC) which had a greater provincial tilt in terms of divisible pool resources","7200":"Coupled

revision of treatment rates under the government\u2019s free healthcare initiative","7243":"Sehat Card Plus chief executive officer Dr Mohammad Riaz Tanoli confirmed the development and said the

criterion for hospital empanelment for the health insurance programme, while a complaint management system was also in place to act against hospitals found to be mistreating patients","7252":"Other officials in the health department insisted that the decision was justified as many hospitals, while not outright denying services to patients, were using delaying tactics due to diminishing profit margins in Sehat Card Plus cases","7253":"They said hospitals continued to charge rates agreed upon five years ago despite increases in gas, electricity, medicine, and diagnostic service costs","7254":"A medical director, who attended the meeting with the health minister, noted that doctor fees had also increased over the last few years, so a rate hike for treatments under the SCP programme also warranted hike","7255":"\u201cOur cardiac surgeons use stents whose international prices continue to rise necessitating an upward revision of rates to ensure timely care so that patients don\u2019t suffer,\u201d he said","7256":"The official anticipated at least a 30 per cent rate increase for cardiology services and other treatments","7257":"He said hospitals were paying five times more in utility bills compared to five years ago, prompting the government to form a committee to consider their demand for rate hikes","7258":"\u201cWith the new elected government in

spoke to, she speculated that \u201celectric machines\u201d that some people use to \u2018pull\u2019 gas can be one of the reasons for the low pressure","7392":"\u201cIf our neighbours use them, that makes the pressure of gas for us very low","7393":"But we don\u2019t know that,\u201d she added","7394":"Malik\u2019s concerns resonate with other homemakers, such as Mona Nayani from DHA Phase-V, who shared similar experiences of dealing with low gas pressure during crucial meal times","7395":"She suspects that the use of \u201celectric machines\u201d by neighbours could be contributing to this issue, depriving them of adequate gas pressure","7396":"The challenges extend beyond just pressure fluctuations","7397":"At times, gas becomes entirely unavailable, forcing residents like Nayani to resort to alternative cooking methods such as preparing \u201crotian\u201d for Sehri at night or purchasing chai from hotels to start the fast without having Sehri","7398":"\u201cBari mushkil se Sehri

gas,\u201d Nayani expressed","7403":"\u201cWhen we visit nearby houses, we notice food being cooked, indicating that people have machines in their homes","7404":"This results in us not getting access to gas between the hours when gas is provided","7405":"Sometimes, the pressure drops to almost zero, making cooking nearly impossible","7406":"\u201dOccasionally, they also have to buy chai from hotels for Sehri","7407":"\u201cSehri kiye bagair roza rakhna parhta hai [We have to fast without eating Sehri],\u201d she expressed","7408":"Living in Lyari, Saba Naveed also said that even though

is not up to the mark at all","7413":"Ap roti nahi bana sakte uspe [You cannot cook Roti using that]","7414":"And by around 9 pm, the gas supply completely vanishes,\u201d she said","7415":"Ishaq has no option but to prepare both Iftar and dinner between 3:30pm and 6:30pm, doubling her workload","7416":"She explained that after this time, the gas supply was insufficient for cooking anything","7417":"Another significant challenge for women like Ishaq is catering to the needs of younger children","7418":"With the gas supply depleted after 9am, she \u201ccannot cook anything for

prepare lunch, she encounters the issue of gas unavailability at the time","7429":"Consequently, Thomas often resorts to eating items like bread that do not require cooking","7430":"Regarding complaints about gas pressure, the SSGC spokesperson emphasised the connection between gas pressure management and the supply of gas","7431":"He explained that if there is insufficient injection of gas into the SSGC\u2019s system, which is responsible for the transmission and distribution of gas, the company faces low-pressure situations","7432":"\u201cIn the current demand-supply gap scenario, the company, however, carries out gas pressure profiling especially at night to ensure that its line pack or distribution system remains sustainable for the majority of the population to keep on getting gas,\u201d Siddiqui said","7433":"Earlier, sources within the power utility informed Dawn that the inadequate and deteriorating distribution system of the gas utility was a primary cause of the city\u2019s low gas pressure","7434":"However, they noted that pressure further decreased during Sehri and Iftar due to the simultaneous use of stoves by the majority of the population","7435":"The SSGC spokesperson also mentioned that the company is \u201cimplementing a master plan in its franchise areas of Sindh and Balochistan\u201d","7436":"This plan includes laying down new gas lines and rehabilitating the old network to improve gas pressure, and supply, and reduce line losses or Unaccounted for Gas (UFG)","7437":"UFG is the difference between how much gas goes

network to those areas that are at a considerable distance from the supply lines\u201d","7444":"Over the past few years, SSGC has made significant efforts to expand and upgrade its network, particularly in areas like DHA, Clifton, and old city regions such as Lyari, he added","7445":"Munira Ali, who resides near Boat Basin in Clifton, mentioned that the gas supply adheres to the schedule

receive gas, but the quantity is significantly low","7450":"With the rush of preparing meals before Iftar, we need to use the machine to pump out gas quickly for timely cooking,\u201d she explained","7451":"Contrarily, Eman Ahmed from North Nazimabad expressed discontent with the use of such machines","7452":"Despite gas supply resuming at 3pm, \u201cits pressure is very low because people with compressors suck it and then we get the bachi kuchi gas [leftover gas] after a while\u201d, she said","7453":"\u201cWe resorted to buying an electric hot plate last Ramazan due to the gas shortages","7454":"Now when we get gas, we cook using that","7455":"Otherwise, we just use the hot plate to cook food,\u201d Ahmed added","7456":"Moreover, she expressed reluctance towards purchasing gas cylinders due to safety concerns such as leakage and the risk of explosion","7457":"Suction pumps or gas compressors are deemed \u201cillegal and dangerous\u201d by the SSGC, as stated by Siddique","7458":"He stressed that using compressors is not just unethical but also robs neighbours of gas, which is already scarce","7459":"\u201cResidents in tail-end areas have been found using

marking schemes","7552":"As the process and systems are different in schools across the country, some kids have to wait for a week while others receive their results a couple of days after the exams","7553":"Unsurprisingly, the longer the wait, the more intense the stress level becomes","7554":"The time between exams and getting results, even though it\u2019s temporary, can affect us","7555":"It shapes how we feel about school and how we deal with tough times for a long time","7556":"Every student goes through this tough journey at some point","7557":"The important thing is how one survives in this phase","7558":"So, my friends, no matter how you did, it\u2019s important to think about this journey with wisdom","7559":"Imagining different result possibilitiesWhile waiting for your exam results, it\u2019s very normal to imagine different possible outcomes in your mind","7560":"You might picture getting the best scores and becoming the topper","7561":"Or you might worry about failing badly","7562":"Thinking about these different \u2018what-ifs\u2019 scenarios is something every student goes through","7563":"Visions of grand success pump you up and keep you motivated to work hard","7564":"However, being overly confident about an ideal outcome can also make the real results disappointing if they don\u2019t match your high expectations","7565":"On the other hand, constantly thinking of failing badly can drain your confidence level","7566":"Negatively imagining the worst case scenario over and over breeds self-doubt","7567":"This anxiety can make you underperform by heightening exam stress","7568":"The key is to find a smart balance and instead of imagining the extremes of being a topper or failing, tell yourself \u201cI prepared well and will likely get a decent score, but there\u2019s also room to do better next time","7569":"\u201d This middle-ground perspective is healthier","7570":"Rumours and exchanging storiesAfter exams, it\u2019s common for students to start discussing and speculating about the exam papers, marking schemes and possible results","7571":"While this post-exam analysis and friends\u2019 discussion may seem harmless, they soon start colouring your expectations about the results","7572":"If most friends feel a particular paper is very difficult, you might convince yourself that your score will be poor","7573":"This can happen even if you prepared well and did well, simply because everyone was saying the paper was difficult","7574":"Similarly, if the high scorers seem confident about topping, you might unnecessarily start doubting your performance","7575":"The views of your mates unintentionally get imprinted on your thoughts","7576":"The key here is to not get caught up in overanalysing the exam paper or marking schemes","7577":"It often leads to more doubt and anxiety","7578":"Besides talking directly, there are often rumours going around groups and social media about how hard the exam papers are and how low the expected scores will be","7579":"For example, someone might say, \u201cI heard from a friend\u2019s cousin that the math exam will be graded super strictly this time, with no leniency","7580":"\u201dThis misinformation gets spread like wildfire and becomes exaggerated","7581":"It increases everyone\u2019s anxiety based on their friends\u2019 worries rather than facts","7582":"In situations like this, don\u2019t panic or make guesses yourself","7583":"The best thing is to stay calm and free your mind from doubts","7584":"Think that whatever your result ends up being, you\u2019ll deal with it and learn from it","7585":"Parents and their expectations A voice that weighs more than anyone in the world is our parents\u2019","7586":"Although they are our well-wishers, sometimes overbearing, parental expectations can feel like an added emotional pressure","7587":"There is no doubt, your parents may have high hopes for your exam scores","7588":"This desire is rooted in love and wanting the best for you","7589":"However, many of you may perceive these hopes as intense expectations that you must meet at any cost","7590":"This is where you experience mental stress","7591":"Listen, kids, you must not view it this way","7592":"Your parents only want you to shine, and not fall behind","7593":"They want to understand your needs before exams and want to help take away all your stress","7594":"Remember, it is not just you worried about your exams, your parents are equally concerned about your future and performance, not just adding pressure","7595":"After the results are announced When the wait is finally over and the results are out, no matter how you did, it\u2019s important to think about this journey with wisdom","7596":"Congratulations to those who cleared their exams with flying colours","7597":"But don\u2019t brag about it, stay humble and use this motivation for your future goals","7598":"But those who are not happy with the results, or perhaps have failed, don\u2019t lose heart","7599":"Every setback gives you a chance to learn and grow stronger than before","7600":"Academic prowess is important, but you always have the chance to start over again","7601":"Your potential goes beyond any score","7602":"Use this experience as a stepping stone in your road to success, not the end of the road","7603":"Most importantly, be kind to yourself and remember that you have  successfully made it through the stressful period of exams and the time after the exams","7604":"Stay focused on your future and long-term goals","7605":"Believe that you can make them happen by working hard","7606":"This is not the end of the road for you; it\u2019s just the start of a brand-new path that can lead you to amazing new opportunities","7607":"Published in Dawn, Young World, May 18th, 2024","7608":"Note: A mere mention in the data is not evidence in itself of financial crime or tax

2024Header photo by Ole Martin WoldThis is part of a series of articles on Dubai Unlocked","7660":"Not too long ago, calls emerged from various quarters for a probe into allegations by six Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges, who decried interference in judicial affairs by the country\u2019s intelligence apparatus","7661":"This isn\u2019t the first time that allegations of such a nature have been aired, yet it is a good time as any to contemplate what judicial independence actually means, how it is threatened and the means to truly attain it","7662":"While we\u2019re on the topic, it is also important to recognise that external independence is one, and not the only factor impacting the judiciary\u2019s independence \u2014 the others being internal and institutional independence","7663":"It is only when all three factors are addressed in unison that a comprehensive strategy safeguarding the judiciary\u2019s independence can be devised","7664":"Now that the issue has taken on national prominence, and the Supreme Court (SC) has taken notice of the matter, let us try and understand the concept","7665":"Given our national dynamics, the first limb \u2014 external independence \u2014 is the most critical","7666":"Like the sturdy pillar that holds the entire edifice of justice, external independence stands tall, guarding against the shadows of unwarranted meddling","7667":"Consider it the guardian angel of our legal sanctum, ensuring that the scales of justice tip not under the weight of external pressures, but solely by the merit of evidence and argument","7668":"It\u2019s the shield that deflects the arrows of manipulation, preserving the sanctity of our judicial process from the clamour of nonjudicial actors seeking to sway its course","7669":"The United Nations\u2019 basic principles weave a compelling narrative around external independence:\u201cThe judiciary shall decide matters before them impartially, on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without any restrictions, improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason","7670":"\u201dExternal independence is also the subject matter before a six-member SC bench hearing petitions pertaining to allegations made in the IHC judges\u2019 letter, which recounts seven instances of alleged interference \u2014 each a haunting reminder of the fragility of justice in the face of external pressures","7671":"These include alleged pressure tactics by intelligence officials on judges refusing maintainability of a disqualification plea against Imran Khan for concealing his alleged daughter","7672":"It also includes the alleged abduction and torture of the brother-in-law of an IHC judge as well as examples of alleged intimidation of district court judges","7673":"In Pakistan, these events stand out like a recurring set of practices, orchestrated by those in power to sway decisions in their favour","7674":"It\u2019s a pattern as old as time, woven into the fabric of governance","7675":"The only way to counter this kind of interference is by the judiciary coming together and drafting a set of proposals that both curtail the nefarious designs of nonjudicial actors and introduce a retributive redressal mechanism should such cases of interference take place","7676":"We must envision a system where justice isn\u2019t a bargaining chip but a sacred trust","7677":"Yet, as we sketch this blueprint, two critical factors demand our attention","7678":"First, the proposals must be dynamic and capable of addressing the changing needs of society, where challenges may evolve, hence the safeguards must too","7679":"For this purpose, the proposals should be subject to periodic reviews and upgrades","7680":"Here, the role of lawyers\u2019 groups cannot be ignored","7681":"Bar associations claim to be guardians of the independence of the judiciary, but they repeatedly resort to thuggery and hooliganism in court over grievances with judges","7682":"Not only does this bring the legal profession into disrepute, but the threats and abuse also serve as improper interference in judicial matters","7683":"Secondly, inclusivity must be our watchword, recognising the unique challenges faced by different tiers of the judiciary","7684":"Interference at the grassroots district courts level differs vastly from the pressures felt in the high courts or the Supreme Court","7685":"A judge\u2019s vulnerability to external influences varies, influenced by the level of institutional support they command","7686":"Internal independence necessitates the implementation of a system that ensures that judges appointed at both the lower and superior court levels are impartial and uphold the highest standards of moral conduct","7687":"As comprehensive as the proposals might be to safeguard against external interference, without impartial judges, the independence of the judiciary will remain a partially baked concept","7688":"Even the most robust defences against external interference falter if the guardians themselves are compromised","7689":"Discipline, impartiality, and professionalism are the bedrock upon which judicial independence rests","7690":"A judge of unwavering integrity stands strong against the tide of corruption, immune to its seductive whispers","7691":"The elevation of judges has been a topic of intense discussion among academic, legal, and political circles for the past few years, garnering the interest and involvement of various civil society stakeholders","7692":"But how do we ensure such stalwart guardianship","7693":"It begins with a meticulous selection process, a journey guided by a predetermined criterion of merit","7694":"Take, for instance, Canada\u2019s vision for the Supreme Court","7695":"They don\u2019t just look at the candidates\u2019 legal acumen; they delve into an assessment of their knowledge, skills, social awareness, sensitivity, sense of ethics, patience, courtesy, honesty, common sense, tact, humility, punctuality, communication skills, ability to manage time and workload, and the capacity to handle workload and stress","7696":"We should also aim for a similar holistic criterion","7697":"Of course, measuring such intangible qualities is no small feat","7698":"It calls for the expertise of those who understand the nuances of human behaviour","7699":"But it\u2019s a challenge worth embracing, for the integrity of our judiciary is a cause that demands nothing less than our very best","7700":"The third limb of the judiciary\u2019s independence requires the strengthening of the institution itself","7701":"What good is a sturdy judge if the platform they stand upon is shaky","7702":"Institutional independence is the backbone \u2014 the state\u2019s guarantee that the judiciary operates free from political entanglements","7703":"It\u2019s about creating a democratic ecosystem where the rule of law isn\u2019t just a slogan but a living, breathing reality","7704":"Any system developed to counter unwarranted interference from nonjudicial actors would be ineffective if the institution is weak \u2014 even if the judges who constitute the institution exercise independence","7705":"Thus, the three limbs of judicial independence must work in tandem","7706":"Institutional independence requires state guarantees","7707":"The state must ensure that the culture of politicisation of the judiciary ends","7708":"This requires the creation of a democratic system that commits to the legal-operational guarantees","7709":"The legislature and executive must perform their constitutional duties and handle issues that fall within their domain","7710":"Parliament must draft strong legislation, and the executive must ensure effective implementation of the laws","7711":"The jurisdiction and competency of the courts must be respected, which must focus on impartial and timely adjudication of disputes","7712":"Involvement by one pillar of government into another should be to serve the constitutional oversight and accountability functions only","7713":"Yet, mere words aren\u2019t enough","7714":"The state must provide more than just assurances; it must furnish the courts with the tools they need to thrive","7715":"Resources, support staff, and yes, smart technology \u2014 these are the building blocks of efficiency","7716":"Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, speaking at the fifth Asma Jahangir Conference, stressed the need to adopt \u201csmart technology\u201d to clear the backlog of 2","7717":"4 million cases","7718":"Justice delayed is justice denied, they say, and in a system burdened with build-up cases, public trust wanes, weakening the institution and creating avenues for interference","7719":"Public perception wields a profound influence on the trajectory of institutions","7720":"Throughout history, we\u2019ve witnessed institutions reshaping their ways in response to mounting public criticism","7721":"When trust dwindles and scepticism grows, institutions find themselves compelled to navigate treacherous waters, often resorting to decisions born out of necessity rather than principle","7722":"It\u2019s a subtle form of intervention, driven by the collective voice of the people","7723":"There is the oft-repeated mantra that justice must not only be done, but it must also be seen to be done","7724":"So even after the three limbs of judicial independence are addressed fully, there remains the added burden to ensure that the judiciary is seen to be independent","7725":"Each limb covered above also requires us to bear the weight of public perception upon our shoulders","7726":"For example, when strengthening the judiciary as an institution, it is important not to do so at the expense of other institutions","7727":"Accountability is the linchpin \u2014 the force that keeps judicial independence from veering into perilous territory","7728":"Without it, the very essence of justice is compromised, damaging the court\u2019s reputation","7729":"The history of judicial activism serves as an example of this argument","7730":"Implementing checks and balances, such as those imposed through the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) [Act][10], 2023 was a very positive development","7731":"It was not an attack on the independence of the judiciary, as it was made out to be","7732":"Similarly, implementing transparency measures advances judicial accountability","7733":"Live broadcasts of SC proceedings have peeled back the layers of courtroom secrecy, fostering a newfound sense of trust","7734":"However, true accountability also demands a free and unfettered press \u2014 recent crackdowns on dissenting voices only tarnish the court\u2019s image, eroding public faith in the process","7735":"Notices issued to journalists critical of the SC\u2019s controversial January 13 verdict to revoke PTI\u2019s electoral symbol, and subsequent mistreatment by the Federal Investigation Agency, was viewed as a concerted attack on free speech","7736":"Even if the SC was not directly involved as a complainant, actions taken by the state caused considerable damage to the apex court\u2019s image","7737":"Targeting of incitement and abuse must be done in a fair and impartial manner that does not make the state, and in this case, the SC, look like an aggressor","7738":"This is why any mechanism developed should include proposals to deal with the media in general, and social media in specific","7739":"But let\u2019s not forget the fundamentals: access to justice, guarantee of due processes, sound judgments, modernised court systems, and reduced delays","7740":"These aren\u2019t just checkboxes; they all play a role in improving public perception of the judiciary","7741":"The independence of the judiciary has become a catchphrase in recent times","7742":"It is being thrown around by those claiming to uphold it, and those actively undermining it","7743":"But in this endless back-and-forth, the essence of the term has been lost in the shuffle, reduced to a hollow monolith devoid of its true purpose","7744":"We must remember that the judiciary\u2019s independence is not an end, but a means to achieve an end","7745":"The actual objective is the rule of law and constitutionalism","7746":"It\u2019s not about isolating the judiciary in an ivory tower but about embedding it within a framework of appropriate legal constraints","7747":"Unfortunately, a rigid binary has emerged, pitting advocates against adversaries in a relentless tug-of-war","7748":"A confrontational stance has pervaded discussions surrounding judicial independence, overshadowing its true significance","7749":"However, a glimmer of hope lies in the realm of meaningful dialogue wherein the pursuit of justice isn\u2019t just a slogan but a shared commitment to change through a nuanced understanding of its role as a means to safeguard greater societal good","7750":"Over the last year, our oceans have been hotter than any time ever recorded","7751":"Our instrumental record covers the last 150 years","7752":"But based on\u00a0proxy observations, we can say our oceans are now hotter than well before the rise of human civilisation, very likely for\u00a0at least 100,000 years","7753":"This isn\u2019t wholly unexpected","7754":"Ocean temperatures have been steadily rising due to human-caused global warming, which in turn means record hottest years have become increasingly common","7755":"The last time ocean temperature records were broken was 2016, and before that it was 2015","7756":"The last year we experienced a record cold year was way back at the\u00a0start of the 20th century","7757":"But what is remarkable about the past year is the huge ongoing spike in global ocean temperatures, which began in April last year","7758":"Last year was hotter than the previous record year by a whopping 0","7759":"25 degree Celsius","7760":"In contrast, the margins of other previous record years were all less than 0","7761":"1 degree Celsius","7762":"Why","7763":"Global warming is the main reason","7764":"But it doesn\u2019t explain why the heat spike has been so large","7765":"Climate drivers such as El Ni\u00f1o likely play a role, as do the random alignment of certain weather events and, possibly, the reduction in sulfur emissions from shipping","7766":"Researchers around the world are trying to understand what\u2019s going on","7767":"Climate change helps explain why ocean temperatures keep rising, but it doesn\u2019t paint the full picture","7768":"And the effects of warmer seas can be devastatingHow big is the jump in heat","7769":"You can see the surge in heat very clearly in the near-global\u00a0ocean surface temperature data","7770":"The trend is clear to see","7771":"Earlier years (in blue) are typically cooler than later years (in red), reflecting the relentless march of global warming","7772":"But even with this trend, there are outliers","7773":"In 2023 and 2024, you can see a huge jump above previous years","7774":"These record temperatures have been widespread, with the oceans of the southern hemisphere, northern hemisphere and the tropics all reaching record temperatures","7775":"What\u2019s behind the surge","7776":"We don\u2019t yet have a complete explanation for this record burst of warming","7777":"But it\u2019s likely several factors are involved","7778":"First, and most obvious, is global warming","7779":"Year on year, the ocean is\u00a0gaining heat\u00a0through the enhanced greenhouse effect \u2014 indeed, some percent\u00a0of the heat associated with human-caused global warming has gone into the oceans","7780":"The extra heat pouring into the oceans results in a gradual rise in temperature, with the trend\u00a0possibly accelerating","7781":"But this alone doesn\u2019t explain why we have experienced such a big jump in the last year","7782":"Then there are the natural drivers","7783":"The El Ni\u00f1o event,\u00a0developing in June\u00a0last year, has certainly played a substantial role","7784":"El Ni\u00f1o and its partner, La Ni\u00f1a, are opposite ends of a natural oscillation, the\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, which plays out in the tropical Pacific Ocean","7785":"This cycle moves heat vertically between the ocean\u2019s deeper waters and the surface","7786":"When El Ni\u00f1o arrives, warmer water comes up to the surface","7787":"During La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite occurs","7788":"You can see the impact of an El Ni\u00f1o on short term temperature spikes clearly, even against a backdrop of strong, long-term warming","7789":"But even climate change and El Ni\u00f1o combined aren\u2019t enough to explain it","7790":"Other natural heat-transferring oscillations, such as the Indian Ocean Dipole or the North Atlantic Oscillation, may play a role","7791":"It may also be that our successful efforts to\u00a0cut aerosol pollution\u00a0from the dirty fuel shipping relies on has had an unwanted side effect:\u00a0more warming","7792":"With less reflective aerosols in the atmosphere, more of the Sun\u2019s energy can reach the surface","7793":"But there\u2019s probably also a level of random chance","7794":"Chaotic weather systems over the ocean can reduce cloud cover, which can let in more solar radiation","7795":"Or these weather systems could weaken winds, reducing cooling evaporation","7796":"Why is this important","7797":"To us, a warmer ocean might feel pleasant","7798":"But the extra heat manifests underwater as an unprecedented series of major marine heat waves","7799":"The ocean\u2019s organisms are picky about their preferred temperature range","7800":"If the heat spikes too much and for too long, they have to move or die","7801":"Marine heat waves can lead to\u00a0mass death or mass migration\u00a0for marine mammals, seabirds, fish and invertebrates","7802":"They can cause vital\u00a0kelp forests and seagrass meadows\u00a0to die, leaving the animals depending on them without shelter or food","7803":"And they can disrupt species important for fisheries and

booth","8215":"In an ideal world, Mahira Khan would put on her best white fit, complete with statement accessories and a neat updo and actually show up to an award show","8216":"Her award acceptance speech would involve thanking the jury, her family and friends and cheers would echo throughout the hall","8217":"In an ideal world, I would complain that the awards\u2019 single most unbearable aspect was how hot it was at the venue in the heat of May, second only to the red carpet fashion faux pas","8218":"Unfortunately, this is not an ideal world, not anymore at least, and that\u2019s not just because celebrities are tired of attending award shows (or so it seems), but because attending award shows during the worst possible time for humanity feels deranged","8219":"In today\u2019s world, there are bigger issues at hand than who won what and why \u2014 such as news stories from Palestine spread across our social media and protests calling for accountability of the Western world and its leaders for allowing the erasure of a people in the name of \u2018self-defence\u2019","8220":"Thankfully, there were some celebrities at this year\u2019s HUM Style Awards who used their platform to acknowledge the madness of the world","8221":"Palestine wasn\u2019t exactly the centre of focus at the first Pakistani awards show since October 7","8222":"It was, however, remembered, courtesy of a handful of stars","8223":"I will start by commending Hania Aamir for being vocal about the issue, not just at the award show, but on her Instagram, which now boasts a hefty 13","8224":"9 million followers, tying her with Ayeza Khan as the most followed Pakistani celebrity on the app","8225":"Aamir received the award of the Most Stylish Actor TV (Female) at the show on Saturday","8226":"She made her way to the stage in a keffiyeh-inspired pink power suit by Nomi Ansari","8227":"The award was presented to her by HUM Network President Sultana Siddiqui","8228":"Taking the mic, Aamir appeared a little hesitant","8229":"The actor thanked HUM, the jury and her friends for considering her while acknowledging that she was nominated amongst a host of \u201ctalented divas\u201d","8230":"Mahira Khan, Saba Qamar, and Ayeza Khan were also on the roster of nominations in the category","8231":"\u201cI don\u2019t think I compare but thank you for the recognition,\u201d she said","8232":"Aamir then asked the audience to take a minute to remember everyone in Gaza, a much-needed request that was met with widespread applause as many, including myself, kept hoping for more celebrities to talk about Palestine \u2014 an expectation that was barely fulfilled","8233":"Siddiqui also clapped for Aamir onstage","8234":"\u201cAll of us over here have a platform","8235":"Whether you\u2019re popular or not \u2014 you have a platform that you can use to amplify your voice","8236":"I would like you to use that platform to demand a ceasefire,\u201d she said","8237":"\u201c#ceasefirenow should never stop trending","8238":"We\u2019re writing history with our actions right now with whatever we\u2019re doing and saying","8239":"So, let\u2019s all be on the right side of history","8240":"\u201dBy now, everyone seemed exhausted from sitting in one place for too long with the air-conditioning perpetually malfunctioning and banter that fell flat","8241":"Save for a few performances, Aamir\u2019s minute-long speech revived the enthusiasm needed to carry the show forward","8242":"Aside from Aamir, singer Bilal Saeed made a fashion statement for Palestine while on the red carpet","8243":"The artist, who later went on to give an electrifying finale performance, stunned in a blazer that boasted the words, \u201cFree Palestine\u201d","8244":"Rapper Faris Shafi also acknowledged that we are going through difficult times before capping off his award acceptance speech with a demand for a free Palestine","8245":"Shafi is known for defying norms and being cut-throat with his music","8246":"Being a staunch critic and an ardent fan of his work, I was not disappointed","8247":"Receiving the award of the Most Stylish Performer, Shafi graced the stage ecstatic","8248":"\u201cOkay","8249":"","8250":"","8251":"What do we do now","8252":"Thanks to Allah and my mother, Saba Hamid, and my sister, Meesha Shafi, who\u2019s taught me everything I know about style,\u201d he said","8253":"@dawn_images #farisshafi received the Hum Style Award in the Most Stylish Performer category","8254":"He graced the stage,

the audience","8258":"He then stated, \u201cThank you","8259":"This is a tough time but we\u2019re making the best of it","8260":"Free Palestine","8261":"\u201d \n\nHis speech was followed up by Asim Azhar\u2019s, who also received the Most Stylish Performer trophy","8262":"Azhar, like many others, did not mention Palestine in his speech, and one wonders whether that had anything to do with him being signed to a big music label","8263":"I\u2019m guessing it takes a certain amount of freedom to be able to advocate for the freedom of others","8264":"However, one must remember that a platform like the HUM Style Awards, like any other award show or gala \u2014 local or international \u2014 is an opportunity to advocate for social causes that demand immediate attention","8265":"So those who are in a position to speak up about Palestine and refuse to do so, need a page from Hania Aamir\u2019s book","8266":"On that note, model Sauban Umais and 19-year-old director-photographer Saboor Akram too made the most of this opportunity","8267":"Akram was the first to receive an award at the show on Saturday \u2014 he won the Rising Star trophy alongside Wear Manto \u2014\u00a0and capped off his speech with the call for a free Palestine","8268":"Umais attended the event with a keffiyeh wrapped around his wrist","8269":"While receiving the trophy in the Best Model (Male) category, he said, \u201cThe more I bow in front of Allah, the more He raises me in status","8270":"The more I fear Him, the less I fear the world","8271":"This award was my sister\u2019s unwavering support","8272":"This award was my friends\u2019 unwavering love","8273":"This award is my mother\u2019s prayer","8274":"And last but not the least, free Palestine","8275":"\u201d \n\nWhile making \u201cpolitical statements\u201d may not be the forte of many celebrities, after Israel\u2019s brutal assault on Gaza that has claimed the lives of over 35,000 Palestinians, I argue that celebrities need to be held to a higher standard","8276":"In light of the movement calling for the mass blocking on social media of celebrities refusing to speak up about Palestine, Pakistani celebrities also need to ask themselves if their influence is worth being jeopardised over their refusal to speak up when lives are at stake, especially when they are being provided a platform on a platter without fear of judgment or scrutiny","8277":"12 YEARS LATER Mishi Khan ain\u2019t happy with singer Abrarul Haq for mentioning that, more than a decade ago, he had received an offer to work in Bollywood","8278":"Apparently, the two have been exchanging not-so-savoury arguments on that subject","8279":"Take for example Mishi K\u2019s following words: \u201c\u201cIf you are such a philanthropist and humanitarian, why go into the details of a project offered to you 12 years back","8280":"Yes, I laughed at you, and I own that","8281":"But have you forgotten when I encouraged you back when you were a teacher","8282":"No one knew you back then","8283":"You once appeared on my channel as well","8284":"\u201d Kya karein Mishi K, people have short memories","8285":"They don\u2019t even remember which singer, actor or actress worked in the \u201990s on PTV","8286":"PAKISTAN AT CANNES It seems that Pakistani filmmaking talent will finally have a platform at the world\u2019s oldest and biggest film festival","8287":"For the first time, Pakistan will have a central hub at the Cannes Film Festival, like many other countries have had for years","8288":"Called the Pakistan

discover and nurture the next generation of talent, preserve film and promote Pakistani and Diaspora films globally, thereby advancing Pakistan\u2019s visual culture","8290":"\u201d Cool\u2026 This was definitely much-needed","8291":"RAPPING TRUTH While most of Hollywood and the music industry are quiet on the issue of Palestine, there are some voices that dare to speak the truth","8292":"American rapper Macklemore is one of them","8293":"He has come out with a track titled Hind\u2019s Hall,focusing on Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and the student community\u2019s protests in the US","8294":"To boot, the proceeds from the streaming of the song will go to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency which aids Palestinian refugees and which the US has cut off funding to, under pressure from Israel","8295":"More praise for Macklemore","8296":"THE DARK SIDE OF THE INDUSTRY Television playwright Bee Gul has raised an issue which people are already aware of but prefer to keep mum about","8297":"During an interview, she lamented that girls who join our showbiz industry often accept sexual exploitation to advance their careers","8298":"She added even good actresses find that route the \u201conly way to the top","8299":"\u201d Bee G is right","8300":"It\u2019s a sad and condemnable scenario","8301":"Unfortunately, it exists in almost all genres of the performing arts \u2014 film, TV and theatre \u2014 and not just in Pakistan","8302":"NEVER BEEN IN LOVE In 2021, singer Zayn Malik and supermodel Gigi Hadid broke up","8303":"Together, they have a baby named Khai","8304":"Subsequently, Gigi H began going out with actor Bradley Cooper, who separated from his partner supermodel Irina Shayk, with whom he too has a daughter","8305":"Zayn M wasn\u2019t happy with his ex\u2019s new affair","8306":"Now, news is that he\u2019s come to terms with Gigi H\u2019s life (apparently for the sake of their baby) and is \u2018happy\u2019 for her","8307":"He has also recently claimed in an interview that he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever been truly in love","8308":"Zayn M, we think Gigi H believes you","8309":"SHE TOO\u2026 Indian actress Sonakshi Sinha appeared on the Kapil Sharma Show on Netflix (the programme, by the way, is a dud, incurring losses to the streaming service) accompanied by the cast of the (awful) series Heeramandi","8310":"As the chit chat went on, the host asked her about her marriage plans, to which she replied that, after seeing Aalia Bhatt and Kiara Advani tying the knot, she too wants to get hitched","8311":"Our best

on Saturday began its second phase of wheat procurement from Faisa\u00adlabad in line with a decision of the federal government to procure 400,000 tonnes more than the original target of 1","8369":"4 million tonnes","8370":"As he kick-started the second phase, Food Minister Rana Tanveer hinted at the possibility of further increasing the target to facilitate farmers","8371":"Passco had originally aimed to purchase 1","8372":"4m tonnes, but after farmers started protesting, the pressure on the federal and provincial governments piled on and the premier decided to increase the target to 1","8373":"8m tonnes","8374":"As of now, Passco has achieved 98 per cent of the initial target and distribution of gunny bags is already underway to meet the increased target","8375":"Farmers, however, are not happy with the government\u2019s decision to procure slightly more wheat than intended","8376":"They said Passco \u2014 a federal body \u2014 operated in 13 out of 97 tehsils in Punjab and the decision to purchase additional wheat from designated areas would have a negligible impact","8377":"According to farmers, the tradeable surplus this year is expected to be about 10m tonnes and buying 400,000 tonnes would hardly make any difference","8378":"Punjab, on the other hand, is reluctant to procure wheat from growers despite province-wide agitations and the persistent stance of farmers","8379":"This has also caused a significant impact on the price of wheat, with the staple being sold at a rate much lower than the official price of Rs3,900 per 40kg","8380":"The Pakistan Kissan Ittehad claimed that farmers had lost Rs1,150 billion under the wheat head alone due to the crashing prices which reportedly dipped below Rs3,000 per 40kg","8381":"Instead of procurement, the Punjab government said it would compensate farmers with interest-free loans of Rs150bn","8382":"Kissan leader Khalid Mahmood Khokar, however, is not impressed, saying the paltry subsidy came at a cost of Rs1,150bn","8383":"\u201cInstead of this gimmickry, please ensure an officially declared price, which the provincial government had itself calculated, announced, and

enough to silence the critics of the PTI governments in the centre and provinces","8402":"He said the PTI-backed candidates won the polls despite being denied a level playing field","8403":"The chief

development has seemingly gone unnoticed in Pakistan","8523":"With the construction of a 50km stretch of the Silk Road, extending from the Wakhan district in Afghanistan to the Chinese border, Afghanistan has successfully established a direct link with China, reducing the distance and lowering the cost of commercial trade between the two countries","8524":"The road was inaugurated by Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development in September 2023, and since then, the two governments have been actively discussing the commencement of traffic through the Wakhan Corridor, which is a narrow strip of territory in northeastern Afghanistan, separating Tajikistan from Pakistan","8525":"The road has the potential to impact Pakistan both positively and negatively","8526":"It may extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) from Pakistan to Tajikistan through Afghanistan, and link the landlocked Central Asian states with the ports in Karachi and Gwadar","8527":"With the opening of the Corridor, a highway linkage between Tajikistan and Pakistan through Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) could be established","8528":"This will create a significant opportunity for enhanced trade and economic activity in the region","8529":"This route may facilitate the trade of minerals, textiles, agricultural products and manufactured goods","8530":"If the CPEC does get extended through Afghanistan to Central Asia, it may further enhance Pakistan\u2019s strategic position as a regional trade hub, increase connectivity with Central Asian markets, and boost economic growth","8531":"Additionally, the corridor would provide Central Asian states with a shorter as well as more efficient route to access international markets via

billion with China, with Pakistan potentially experiencing a reduction in its geopolitical advantage and security leverage over Afghanistan","8535":"For China, the opening of the Wakhan border would help extend its reach to diverse markets as part of the larger Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) even though security and cross-border terrorism will continue to be Beijing\u2019s primary focus in this case","8536":"China has already signed impressive multi-billion-dollar agreements for access to lithium deposits, and to develop Afghanistan\u2019s largest copper deposit near Kabul","8537":"Besides,

either via sea or through the Karakoram Highway (KKH), will be diverted towards Wakhan","8539":"This in effect will mean that all cargo currently being transported through the KKH, as seen in the accompanying picture, will be diverted to Wakhan, depriving the KKH of a significant amount of traffic, and depriving the government of Pakistan of transit fees, levies and customs duties","8540":"Besides, Pakistani trucks might go out of business","8541":"It is imperative for Islamabad to develop a comprehensive vision, mission, strategy as well as a plan focussing on the

to go to jail","8851":"If only a 100 of us become soldiers and each of us kills 20 lakhs of them, we will be victorious\u2026\u201dModi is circumspect in his speeches now, but was not always so","8852":"As chief minister of Gujarat, soon after the pogrom there in 2002 during his term that left at least 2,000 dead, mostly Muslim, he was often reported in his public speeches to evoke visions of a religious struggle of good over evil","8853":"\u201cThis is the holy place of shakti [godly power], the power for extermination of asuras [demons],\u201d he said in one speech","8854":"\u201cWe have resolved to destroy and stamp out all forces of evil\u2026\u201dBeyond the goal of cleansing the Hindu land of the \u201ccancer\u201d to save the nation, there is another equally compelling reason for the Hindutva project to be more than just about marginalising Muslims","8855":"That has to do with the fact that India today is, in the words of historians Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot, \u201can intricate montage assembled from assorted material\u201d, of which the Islamic is a critical element","8856":"The desire on the part of Hindutva leaders to fully realise Hindu supremacy will also require extirpating Muslim life and Muslim imprint from today\u2019s India","8857":"Historians view the era between 1200 AD and 1750 AD (Medieval India in history textbooks) as the foundation for the highly diverse human landscape of modern South Asia, with its pluralistic culture that draws on both Indic and Islamic traditions","8858":"In their magisterial work, India Before Europe (2006), Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot show how the Central Asian ethnic heritage, Persian cultural orientation and Islamic religious affiliation of North India\u2019s ruling elite class in the period after 1200 AD led to the dissemination of many innovative elements through the subcontinent","8859":"While acknowledging that the encounter between Indic and Islamic peoples and cultures led to short-term conflicts, Asher and Talbot note the vast degree to which cultural practices inspired by Perso-Islamic traditions became integral to the subcontinent as a whole in the long run","8860":"South Asia\u2019s art and architecture, its political rituals, its administrative and military technologies and even its popular religions were deeply inflected by the new forms","8861":"This composite culture, the authors note, forms the basis of India that exists today, in its foods, dressing and music, languages that people speak, the built architecture, and its popular religions, among others","8862":"The ruins of the Krishna temple in Hampi, Karnataka, in 1868","8863":"Credit: Lyon, Edmund David (1825-1891)","8864":", Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons \u2014 taken from Scroll","8865":"in\nIn the south of the peninsula, the \u2018Hindu\u2019 Vijaynagara empire (1350-1550) drew significantly from Islamicate influence in military technology, secular architecture, courtly dress, as well as local languages","8866":"The successor \u2018Muslim\u2019 sultanates of the Bahmani state in the Deccan too, followed in this tradition, most importantly in their patronage to local languages, so much so that Golconda rulers, around today\u2019s Hyderabad, occupied an important place in the historical memory of Telengana language \u2014 with one of the sultans, Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah (1550-1580) often called Ibharama Chakravati by Telgu poets","8867":"Bijapur\u2019s Ibrahim Adil Shah II (1580-1627), called Jagat Guru, authored a collection of songs in dakani, Kitab-e-Nauras (book of nine rasas), that opens with an invocation to Saraswati, Hindu goddess of learning, followed by praise of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and then the Chisti saint Gisu Daraz","8868":"These were no exceptions","8869":"In Bengal, the Hussain Shahi (1493-1538) rulers adopted local customs, such as purification by the water of Ganga at coronation ceremonies, and the Sufi poet, Saiyid Sultan (d 1648) published a genealogy of prophets of Islam, called Nabi Vamsha that included the Hindu god, Krishna","8870":"In Gujarat, amid the flourishing literary tradition that the Ahmad Shah rulers patronised was the Sanskrit work Raja-Vinoda (pleasure of the kings), written in honour of the ruler, Mahmud Begada (1460s), presenting the sultan as an ideal Indic king, whose court was graced by the presence of the Hindu deity Saraswati, the goddess of learning","8871":"In Malwa, in central India, capital Mandu had fine libraries that included among their collection the track Nimat-nama (c","8872":"1500), an illustrated recipe book for making dishes suitable for all seasons, including vegetarian as well as meat-based, with illustrations drawing on both Persian and Indic tradition, including the Bhagwata Purana","8873":"However, it was the Mughals, especially Akbar (1556-1605), who helped create a state that was more Indian in character","8874":"The aesthetic that developed under Akbar\u2019s guidance was composed of a fusion of Timurid and Indic models, and which went on to set a standard for subsequent Mughal arts and culture, including food, architecture and courtly dress and culture, Asher and Talbot argue","8875":"Besides, in the realm of built architecture, of which there is ample evidence, literary production was an important site of Indic and Islamic collaboration","8876":"Examples are the translation of Ramayana and Mahabharata in Persian (Razm-nama) and Abul Fazl\u2019s including in his Ain-i-Akbari, extensive sections on \u201cthe learning of India\u201d \u2014 including philosophical schools, music, life cycle rituals, and modes of image worship","8877":"The scale of the borrowing led Audrey Truschke, a prominent historian of Sanskrit at the Mughal court, to conclude that these were efforts on the part of Abul Fazl to convince Akbar\u2019s supporters of the virtues of infusing Sanskrit knowledge into Indo-Persian thought","8878":"The tendencies towards synthesis had significant consequences","8879":"Man Singh, the highest ranking noble in Akbar\u2019s court, only after his sons, built temples throughout the domain, including the Govinda Deva temples in Vrindavan, the largest in North India, in a recognisably Mughal style, and helped to spread Akbar\u2019s belief in multiculturalism, just as Abdul Rahim Khaan-e-Khanan did by commissioning an illustrated Ramayana","8880":"Among the most consequential contributions of the Mughal court to Indian letters, Allison Busch shows, was its engagement with Brajbhasha","8881":"A local (Hindavi) dialect of the region around Agra and Delhi, Mughal heartlands, Brajbhasha had existed until then, mostly as bhakti devotional poetry","8882":"Under Mughal patronage, it developed a sophisticated courtly style, inspired by Sanskrit poetics, and became the principal poetic language of north India","8883":"In creating the outcome, that could be described as classical Hindi, were Akbar\u2019s nobles composing works in the language, including Todar Mal, Birbal and the Rajput nobles, as also Faizi and Abdul Rahim Khana Khanan \u2014 showing how courtly literature in Brajbhasha was nurtured within the multicultural context of elite Mughal society","8884":"There were other enduring contributions too, of this age and milieu, outside the courtly realm","8885":"A major influence in the early part of this period was Sufis, and their dispersal, throughout much of the subcontinent","8886":"By the 14th century, the practice of Sama, devotional musical congregations, and Urs, annual pilgrimage to the shrines of Sufi saints, had become established Sufi traditions","8887":"Sufi shrines drew both Muslims and Hindus, and were themselves influenced by local traditions, including the Shattari Sufis of Bengal drawing on Nath yogis, and Rishi Sufis of Kashmir who led celibate lives and practised vegetarianism","8888":"Sufism also contributed to reform in Hindu tradition, starting in the 14th century with the rise of sants, who like Sufis, were mystics, believed in a formless God, and extolled devotion to God as a primary religious practice","8889":"Kabir, the most influential, attacked rituals and customs of traditional religions, and excoriated the caste system","8890":"Guru Nanak (born in 1469), the founder of the Sikh tradition, also came from the same context","8891":"Notably, Sufism also influenced Hindu bhakti tradition, as the historian of Indian religion John S Hawley points out","8892":"This is evident in the commonalities that the latter began to show in its focus on love for God, as did Sufis, the use of poetry and music in worship, and an ethics of compassion for others","8893":"Tulsidas\u2019s Ramcharitmanas (1575), crafted in about the same age and the middle Gangetic Awadhi milieu of Sufi poets, Malik Mohammad Jayasi (Padmavat, 1540) and Mir Siyyid Manjhan (Madhumalati, 1545), exemplified this shift","8894":"Ram, an incarnation of Vishnu, became the preeminent object of devotion, in place of Siva","8895":"It is these constructions of a cosmopolitan Indian paradigm, resulting in innovations that spoke to both traditions that Hindu nationalists must disentangle and destroy to be able to achieve their vision of a Hindu supremacist India","8896":"This will undoubtedly leave much violence in its trail","8897":"These historical accounts of co-living and co-production contradict Hindutva claims that have much purchase today, in popular as well as scholarly circles about the thousand years of conflict between Muslim \u201coutsiders\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d Hindus; of forced conversions and the wanton destruction of temples","8898":"Hindu nationalists have developed a wide repertoire of suffering and victimhood of Hindus at the hands of Muslims","8899":"Evidence to support their thesis is slim","8900":"Richard Eaton, one of the foremost historians of medieval India, shows how the claim that Islam spread in South Asia by the sword is incongruent with the geography of Muslim conversions in South Asia","8901":"There is an inverse relationship between the degree of Muslim political penetration and the degree of conversion to Islam, he notes","8902":"Most conversions happened in the north west and north east \u2014 Punjab and Bengal, farthest away from centres of Muslim power","8903":"As to temple destruction, Eaton found, over a span of more than five centuries from 1192 to 1729, there were \u201csome 80 instances of temple desecration\u201d, well short of the 60,000 claimed by Hindu nationalists","8904":"Typically, the desecrated temples would have been associated with the authority of an enemy kingdom","8905":"The instances of desecrations followed a long-established pattern in India, of temples having been natural sites for the contestation of kingly authority, well before the coming of Muslim Turks, including their destruction","8906":"Among the most recent examples was the destruction in the 10th c of the Pratihara temple of Kalapriya near Jamuna, by the Rashtrakuta king Indra III","8907":"But as the Bosnian historian, Edin Hajdarpasic, shows from his study of Balkan nationalism in the 19th century, enthusiastic depictions of suffering convey the essence of a political threat more vividly than simple facts or documentary narratives \u2014 a phenomenon he calls \u201cauthentic fantasy\u201d","8908":"Hindu nationalists, themselves inspired by European nationalist movements at the turn of the 19th century, relied much on the construction of suffering and victimhood of Hindus, however divorced from facts","8909":"Decolonial historiography shows how they drew on the Orientalist bias of British colonial historians, who saw the period of the previous 600 years, as a history of Muslim arrival and their dominance over Hindus, marked by Muslim fanaticism, and temple destruction, forced conversion, and Hindu oppression","8910":"In contrast to the dark Muslim medieval age, colonial historians like James Mill posited the ancient Hindu age as golden, and modern British, as liberal","8911":"Hindu nationalists in power today are seeking to inflict retribution for their perceived sufferings by rewriting history","8912":"In some cases, this has taken physical forms \u2014 such as in the destruction in 1992 of the 15th century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, a criminal act that was legitimised by the Supreme Court of India in 2019","8913":"Claims for several other historical mosques to be converted into temples have been set in motions across the country","8914":"Elsewhere, place names have been changed to erase any hint of their Muslim heritage","8915":"Allahabad is now Prayagraj, Mughalsarai station is Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction, Aurangabad is Sambhajinagar and Gulbarga is Kalaburagi","8916":"Not satisfied with occasional erasures, the BJP government has thought fit to change high school history and politics textbooks by significantly altering and in some cases, fully scrapping the sections on Mughal history","8917":"Credit: Yasminsheikh, CC BY-SA 4","8918":"0 via Wikimedia Commons \u2014 taken from Scroll","8919":"in\nThe act of political forgetting targets minorities to deprive them of history, of the right to narrate, of the capacity for recognition","8920":"History tells us it is also a precursor to violence","8921":"As eminent historians Aditya and Mridula Mukherjee noted recently, \u201c\u2026genocide of a community is often preceded by the community being demonised, their names changed, their history being erased\u201d, claiming \u201cthese processes have begun in India and open calls for genocide of Muslims are being given in various parts of the country with amazing impunity\u201d","8922":"More than Jim Crow South, the history of the Balkans in the late 19th century and post-Yugoslavia 20th century provides a better guide to understanding the future of minorities in India today","8923":"Hajdarpasic\u2019s account of Balkan history alerts us to the real consequences of the claims of victimhood","8924":"Nationalists there used stories of suffering not only to inspire collective sacrifice but also to encourage mass violence against entire communities perceived as threats","8925":"He demonstrates how certain stories of victimisation in the region long outlived their original inspirations","8926":"Decades after overthrowing Turkish rule, Serbian nationalists could revive narratives about Turk-like enemies even in the late 20th century with catastrophic consequences","8927":"Tanika Sarkar, eminent historian of modern India, demonstrates similar impulse in early modern Hindu nationalist thought","8928":"Emblematic of this repertoire was Bankim Chandra Chatterjee\u2019s 1818 novel, Anandmath, whose main character, the Hindu sanyasi (ascetic) rebel, Satyanand, is engaged in a messianic battle \u201cfor exterminate(ing) all Muslims on this land, as they are enemies of God\u201d, a recompense for \u201cinflicting misfortune on Hindus\u201d","8929":"The novel is set in the context of the 1770 famines in Bengal, as the East India Company was inserting itself at the expense of the Nawabs of Bengal, and that resulted in a third of the population starving to death, both Hindus and Muslims","8930":"Historians inform Muslim fakirs (ascetics) rose up, along with sanyasis, against the depredations","8931":"Sarkar calls for Anandmath, \u201cthe first explicit message in our literary history for ethnic cleansing\u201d, one foretelling Hindu nationalist thoughts to emerge later in 20th century","8932":"Its protagonists deemed \u201celimination of Muslim rule and Muslim presence from the land\u201d an act of worship of Bharat Maata (motherland), a deity that first emerged in the novel","8933":"In 1920, Savarkar and Golwalkar adopted Vande Mataram \u2014 hymn to Bharat Maata, contained in Anandmath \u2014 as  aHindu nationalist anthem","8934":"Vande Mataram was also the rallying cry of Hindu communalists in anti-Muslim violence to follow during Partition","8935":"Vande Mataram continues to inspire Hindu nationalist thoughts and action to this day","8936":"So when the terror-accused BJP MP Pragya Thakur recently instructed her audience to \u201ckeep your weapons sharpened\u201d, to \u201cin this world created by god \u2026 finish all oppressors, wrong-doers, sinners\u2026\u201d, she was deploying Anandmath\u2019s template of the holy war \u2014 calling for violence against the entire Muslim population","8937":"It is in such violent contestations borne out of \u2018authentic fantasies\u2019 of past sufferings that Hindu nationalists of today \u2014 following that of Savarkar and other Hindutva ideologues \u2014 seek to create Hindu supremacy, by waging permanent war against India\u2019s 200 or so million Muslims and other \u2018foreign elements\u2019","8938":"Already, United Nations experts are alerting us to the fact that \u201cIndia risks becoming one of the world\u2019s main generators of instability, atrocities and violence, because of the massive scale and gravity of the violations and abuses targeting mainly religious and other minorities, such as Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and others","8939":"\u201dMass atrocity experts are warning:  \u201cIf nothing is done to address these risks, India may continue to experience a rise in the number of violent (and fatal)

stylishly dressed","8976":"This year\u2019s HSAs had their highs and lows but what people wore on the red carpet has to be attributed to their own bad taste and not be blamed on the event","8977":"At

discover later, since much of his writing played around with the role of coincidence and fortuition in our lives","9510":"Of course, I didn\u2019t actually run into Paul Auster, who I had no idea about before that moment","9511":"I just chanced upon one of his books called The Book of Illusions","9512":"Under normal circumstances I might have put the book back on the shelves after reading the blurb on the back","9513":"It tried to pitch the book as a \u201csearing portrait of grief\u201d or something along those lines","9514":"Under normal circumstances, that might have been enough to put me off","9515":"But I was going through some things at the time that had put me in a different frame of mind and, despite the heaviness of the blurb, I was somehow drawn to the book, its title and the fact that it apparently involved a filmmaker who had stopped making films","9516":"I decided to buy it","9517":"When I started reading the novel, I couldn\u2019t let go","9518":"Let me just tell you the set-up to the story and I promise this is not a spoiler","9519":"The novel begins with the young family \u2014 wife and two kids \u2014 of a college professor dying in a plane crash in the 1980s","9520":"The tragedy devastates the professor and he cuts himself off from the world and sinks into depression and alcoholism","9521":"He takes leave from the college and spends his time alone at home, drinking and mindlessly flipping through channels on television","9522":"Six months or so later, one day while surfing TV, he comes across a documentary about a rising star silent era comedian who made only 11 films before vanishing during the American Great Depression, in 1929","9523":"Speculation was that he had either committed suicide or had been killed by someone","9524":"I was somehow drawn to the book, its title and the fact that it apparently involved a filmmaker who had stopped making films","9525":"I decided to buy it","9526":"One of the clips from his films makes our professor laugh for one second","9527":"He realises this is the first time in over six months that he had found any form of joy, even fleeting, and he gets obsessed about this comedian he had never heard of before","9528":"He discovers that prints of the comic star\u2019s handful of films are lying with various cinematheques around the world","9529":"He decides to travel to them to watch those silent films and writes a slim book about them \u2014 although he has no previous interest in writing on films \u2014 treating it like an exercise to keep himself occupied","9530":"Once this niche book comes out, he goes back to his previous routine, until he receives a letter that upends his life","9531":"That is the set-up to a novel that builds a world that sucks you in but actually traverses ideas about healing from grief, about memory and erasure and reinventing oneself","9532":"I was so enamoured of Auster\u2019s writing style that I would force myself not to read any more than 20 pages a night, in the hope that the book would not end","9533":"It was the first and only time I\u2019ve ever done that","9534":"Even with only reading 20 pages a day, however, the book did of course, inevitably, end","9535":"I am fully aware that my circumstances may not apply to other readers but, somehow, I felt this work of fiction helped me come out of the funk I had been struggling with","9536":"Most people will refer to Auster\u2019s more well-known works, such as The New York Trilogy, or the Booker Prize-nominated 4 3 2 1 but, for me, no other had the impact of that first book of his I read","9537":"Immediately after finishing the book, I felt compelled to write out a letter to the author, detailing my experience with his novel and expressing a desire to adapt it into a film","9538":"This is also the only time I have ever written something like this","9539":"I thought I had discovered someone brilliant and new","9540":"But then I did some research and discovered that not only was Paul Auster a very well-known and highly regarded author, but that he had also penned scripts to and co-directed at least two films that I had already seen","9541":"I also found out he was protective of his privacy, although he was also apparently a warm and empathetic human being","9542":"To be honest, I was embarrassed by my own ignorance","9543":"I never sent the letter","9544":"But I did start reading more of Paul Auster","9545":"And I recommended The Book of Illusions to any who asked me","9546":"In fact, I also gave away a bunch of copies to friends","9547":"Some months later, I was recommending the book to the writer and historian Nasreen Rehman \u2014 who at the time was consulting on a Bollywood film \u2014 and she surprised me by telling me that it was one of two books recommended to her by Shah Rukh Khan","9548":"I was sure at the time that this signalled that SRK was also interested in turning it into a film, but it also raised his estimation in my eyes","9549":"I heard about Paul Auster\u2019s passing from my friend the novelist Mohammad Hanif, who called from London to inform me of it, because he remembered my obsession with him and felt I was the only person he could condole with","9550":"I never met Paul Auster but I felt I understood at least parts of him","9551":"It\u2019s a reminder that differences of culture, background and experiences are often secondary to the commonality of human emotions","9552":"The Book of Illusions begins with an epigraph from French memoirist Chateaubriand who the professor is translating: \u201cMan has not one and the same life","9553":"He has many lives, placed end to end, and that is the cause of his misery","9554":"\u201dI should have sent that

posters along with framed photographs of the late couple Abdul Sattar Edhi and Bilquis Edhi","9617":"Children in the classrooms are busy making greeting cards, drawing pictures of themselves and the only woman whom they have come to know as their mother, their Chhoti (younger) Mummy Sabah Faisal Edhi","9618":"The duties of the busy mother of so many children, including four of her own, starts from early morning","9619":"After tending to her own household duties and sending off her youngest, Moosa Edhi, to school, she is in the nursery at 8am sharp, inquiring from the staff there if everyone had a good sleep, if anyone had any issues during the night","9620":"It has become a habit with her to visit the nursery first to inquire about her babies before getting to her other work of calling up the other Edhi Homes and Centres, asking about the other children, their health and school progress, asking about the women in their Homes, tending to the marriage proposals, and adoption procedures and planning outings and picnics for the children","9621":"When parents discover their babies are \u2018not well\u2019, they quietly leave them in our cot, says Sabah Edhi as country

herself, after her own youngest grandson, Sabah and Faisal\u2019s youngest son Moosa","9626":"But this Moosa, even though he is five, doesn\u2019t look more than a year old","9627":"His growth is

someone left a little girl suffering from diarrhoea","9641":"She had to be hospitalised,\u201d she informs","9642":"Just then one little girl, of about four years of age, who also looks like she is

healthy grow up to discard their parents when they are old and weak","9653":"That\u2019s the story of so many old people in our homes,\u201d she concludes","9654":"Published in Dawn, May 12th, 2024","9655":" In a teaser video for her third album, Radical Optimism, Dua Lipa explained that every track has that \u201cthrough-the-struggle-you-are-going-to-make-it\u201d optimistic feeling","9656":"She has also said that the album \u201ctaps into the pure joy and happiness of having clarity in situations that once seemed impossible to face","9657":"\u201d She added: \u201cThe hard goodbyes and vulnerable beginnings that previously threatened to crush your soul, become milestones as you choose optimism and start to move with grace through the chaos","9658":"\u201dThis \u201cchaos\u201d is a feeling all too familiar for many young adults today","9659":"The philosophy of radical optimism sounds like an answer to the confusion that often accompanies our 20s and 30s","9660":"So, should we all seek to harness \u201cradical optimism\u201d, to gain the kind of clarity and fortitude Lipa speaks of, in our own lives","9661":"I\u2019m a pragmatist philosopher researching how we can constructively and honestly face personal and collective catastrophe","9662":"While I like the idea of fostering a hopeful and empowering outlook when facing life\u2019s many challenges, I worry that radical optimism can have some damaging consequences","9663":"Radical optimism isn\u2019t a singular recognisable philosophical school of thought, so it can be hard to pin down exactly what it means","9664":"If pessimism is the expectation that mostly bad things will happen, then optimism is the expectation that mostly good things will happen","9665":"Radical optimism stresses the importance of agency and responsibility in understanding our negative experiences, prescribing a mindset that things will ultimately work out for the better","9666":"Dua Lipa says her new album title is also her philosophy for dealing with life\u2019s chaos \u2014 but is it the best way","9667":"This might sound a lot like the deeply unscientific \u201claw of attraction\u201d, which suggests that positive thoughts can somehow cosmically \u201cattract\u201d positive outcomes, such as wealth and success","9668":"But radical optimists, much like people who follow stoicism, generally place a greater emphasis on equanimity (calmness and composure in difficult situations) than fans of the \u201claw of attraction","9669":"\u201d They believe that confidence and trust are better ways of dealing with problems than fear and worry","9670":"The perceived importance of happiness and positivity is so embedded in our culture that phrases like \u201cstay positive\u201d or \u201cbe kind to yourself\u201d seem to have become the common sense adages of our age","9671":"In most cases, they serve as simple reminders not to be too hard on ourselves","9672":"This is appropriate, because humans tend to suffer from a negativity bias \u2014 we notice and dwell more readily on negative experiences than positive ones","9673":"Taken too literally, however, these adages can result in \u201ctoxic positivity\u201d \u2014 a compulsion to present an upbeat attitude, regardless of how you authentically feel","9674":"This can be damaging, as it can lead to desensitisation and even dissociation, by hindering your capacity to discern your true feelings and values","9675":"It can also disconnect you from valuable experiences of sadness, frustration, anger and grief","9676":"Radical optimism ultimately aims for a middle way between toxic positivity and fearful pessimism","9677":"But when coming from a megastar like Lipa, the message of radical optimism can feel a bit rich","9678":"On the whole, with a positive attitude and appropriate efforts, things probably will work out for privileged people like her","9679":"But is the same thing true for those living within the normal range of talents, gifts and wealth","9680":"If not, then embracing radical optimism could actually be a mild self-delusion, heightening expectations that simply can\u2019t be met and, so, causing greater despair down the line","9681":"I suspect that Lipa is not blind to this, as she has shared her own experiences of suffering and is the daughter of refugees","9682":"The album title comes from her 2021 Grammy acceptance speech, when she said:\u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve really come to realise is how much happiness is so important","9683":"I felt really jaded at the end of my last album, where I felt like I only had to make sad music to feel like it mattered \u2026 happiness is something that we all deserve and something that we all need in our lives","9684":"\u201dThese words were heartfelt and poignant, personal but also collective, since they arrived on the screens of millions of people during the pandemic \u2014 probably feeling a good deal of fear and despair","9685":"In times of duress, allowing yourself to hope for future happiness is both healthy and helpful","9686":"However, directly trying to boost our happiness has a tendency to make it recede ever further on the horizon","9687":"Psychologists have amassed a trove of data about happiness, and it turns out that happy people rarely think about their own subjective happiness","9688":"Instead, they direct their attention towards things that they find intrinsically valuable (like personal passions or their sense of purpose) and towards their relationships with others","9689":"They also tend to be physically active and regularly feel grateful","9690":"Meliorism and being \u2018radically open\u2019I think a better approach than radical optimism is to understand that the future is radically open","9691":"The American philosopher and psychologist John Dewey described \u201cmeliorism\u201d as \u201cthe belief that the specific conditions which exist at one moment, be they comparatively bad or comparatively good, in any event may be bettered","9692":"\u201d In other words, Dewey thought that we should believe that we can make progress, but understand that it demands personal and often collective efforts","9693":"A well-grounded hope that recognises the radical openness of the future can bolster our initiative and deepen our compassion","9694":"It also avoids unhelpful forms of emotional suppression","9695":"As the great existential psychotherapist Irvin Yalom said, facing the negative parts of human life (mortality, loss, isolation, uncertainty) head-on can be a powerful experience that yields self-knowledge and life-sustaining meaning","9696":"It can help us to slay superficial, comfortable hopes, to allow for a deeper, less shaky, form of hope to grow","9697":"Understood in the right way, meliorism can see us through the most painful and confusing times in our life more effectively than any kind of simplistic optimism","9698":"That\u2019s because it can remind us of our own frailty and fallibility, while at the same time affirming our agency and interdependence","9699":"It reminds us to ask for help and to believe that our habits, actions and beliefs ultimately matter in helping us find a way through","9700":"Perhaps, meliorism is what Lipa is really referring to when she speaks of \u201cradical optimism","9701":"\u201d I will have to listen to the album carefully to know for sure","9702":"But I admit it: \u201cradical meliorism\u201d isn\u2019t quite such a catchy

says she was jailed for terrorism offences","9790":"According to Amnesty International, al-Otaibi was sentenced in a \u201csecret hearing before the country\u2019s notorious counter-terrorism court, the Specialised Criminal Court, on January 9, 2024, but the decision was only revealed weeks later in the Saudi government\u2019s formal reply to a request for information in a Joint Communication by UN Special Rapporteurs about her case\u201d","9791":"The rights group said that the charges against her pertained to her choice of clothing, publishing videos of herself wearing \u2018indecent clothes\u2019 and going shopping without an abaya","9792":"Saudi Arabia does not have laws mandating women to wear abayas in public spaces, however, culturally women are encouraged to cover up","9793":"The charges against her include her expression of views online, which included a call to end Saudi Arabia\u2019s male guardianship system \u2014 which, according to the Human Rights Watch, is Saudi Arabia\u2019s first codified law on personal status that \u201cformally enshrines male guardianship over women; the law contains discriminatory provisions against women concerning marriage, divorce, and decisions about their children\u201d","9794":"Al-Otaibi\u2019s sister, Fawzia al-Otaibi faces similar charges, but fled Saudi Arabia fearing arrest after being summoned for questioning in 2022, Amnesty International added","9795":"However, the Saudi regime is insistent that al-Otaibi was charged under articles 43 and 44 of the Kingdom\u2019s counter-terrorism laws, which criminalise

11-year sentence is an appalling and cruel injustice","9800":"Since the moment she was arrested, Saudi Arabia\u2019s authorities have subjected her to a relentless catalogue of abuses, from unlawful

both her education and personal growth","9857":"Moreover, in developing countries such as Pakistan, the unregulated cycle of childbirth places a heavy financial strain on parents, as they struggle to support multiple children, ultimately perpetuating poverty within these families","9858":"Despite tireless global campaigns and legal enforcement in these countries, the insidious practice of child marriage persists","9859":"This prevalence is fuelled by a glaring lack of awareness regarding the severe repercussions of such unions, amplifying the issue","9860":"The plight of girls under 18 is

physical maturity is typically achieved post-puberty,\u201d she explained","9876":"Consequently, girls under 18 years face heightened risks of complications, and if they contract fistula, their suffering is only magnified","9877":"Throughout pregnancy and childbirth, the absence of adequate treatment can result in a spectrum of deformities in women\u2019s bodies, often leading to the onset of debilitating diseases","9878":"Among these, fistula stands out as one of the most distressing, inflicting not only physical discomfort but also profound psychological and social ramifications","9879":"Girls married off at a young age have underdeveloped bodies and fragile bones","9880":"If they undergo childbirth before their bodies have fully matured, they are at risk of developing fistula","9881":"Similarly, older women who have borne numerous children may experience weakened muscles, rendering them incapable of delivering the baby during childbirth","9882":"In some cases, it may also lead them to develop this condition","9883":"In both scenarios, giving birth to a child becomes an excruciating process for the woman, wherein the pressure exerted by the baby\u2019s head against the muscles between the bladder and the vagina may result in the formation of a fistula","9884":"In many cases, the babies are stillborn","9885":"Without immediate medical intervention, the affected woman is condemned to endure the pain","9886":"The Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, a federal law in Pakistan in alignment with international conventions on

conducted in 2016-17, the prevalence of child marriages in Gilgit-Baltistan, especially in areas such as Chilas, Darel, Tangir, and Kharmang, stands alarmingly high, soaring to approximately 26pc","9890":"Despite concerted efforts to tackle the issue, including the introduction of legislation in 2015, progress has been hindered by opposition within the legislative assembly, leading to delays in its enactment","9891":"While the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 is in place, its enforcement in these regions falls well short of the mark","9892":"And without a legal mandate imposing age restrictions, many see no obligation to adhere to the law","9893":"Subsequently, the absence of robust legislation and effective enforcement mechanisms perpetuates the cycle of child marriages, leaving the issue entirely unresolved","9894":"Child marriage is not merely a tradition; it has a direct bearing on human health and development","9895":"While marriage may bring a sense of satisfaction for many, it also entails significant responsibilities, demanding mental, physical, and financial preparedness","9896":"Experts argue that minors lack the maturity essential for a thriving marriage, posing potential health risks","9897":"We cannot afford the luxury of complacency while the innocence of our children is sacrificed at the altar of an archaic practice","9898":"It falls upon each of us, as guardians of our collective conscience, to demand comprehensive legislation that will dismantle the structures perpetuating child marriages","9899":"For the sake of our daughters and sons, for the preservation of their health, dignity, and dreams, we must act decisively","9900":"The time for rhetoric has passed; it is now time for action","9901":"Header image \u2014

the at least seven million Pakistanis who were displaced in the \u2018biblical\u2019 floods of two years ago","9904":"An October 2023 report of the International Office of Migration (IOM) said that over a million of those displaced were yet to be resettled","9905":"Barkat\u2019s family, which hails from Lower Kohistan in the country\u2019s northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, is among those unfortunate ones","9906":"They had to leave their homes in Baneel \u2014 a small village surrounded mostly by pine trees in the Dubair Valley \u2014 with \u201conly the clothes on their back,\u201d he tells Eos","9907":"Before moving to the town of Oghi in nearby Mansehra, Barkat and his family spent over a year in a relative\u2019s field nearby, sleeping under the open sky","9908":"During this time, continues Barkat, the family was hopeful of returning to their land and rebuilding their house","9909":"\u201cWhile we had lost our home and cattle, we still had land,\u201d he says, adding that they grew enough wheat and maize as well as fruits and vegetables to not have to worry about food","9910":"While the 2022 floods caused mayhem nationwide, such climate-induced calamities are happening more frequently in Pakistan\u2019s mountainous north","9911":"In a once prosperous and scenic valley in Kohistan, forced migrations are turning into an exodusBut the slow pace of reconstruction \u2014 the public health facilities in Dubair that were damaged during the flood have not yet been reconstructed, while the hydroelectric power station on the Dubair River in Ranolia also remains offline \u2014 compelled them to seek refuge elsewhere","9912":"\u201cEverything is gone,\u201d he continues wistfully, as he takes a break from his work as a daily-wage labourer in Oghi, Mansehra","9913":"\u201cIt was not easy to leave our home,\u201d says Barkat","9914":"\u201cEveryone cried a lot","9915":"My father was constantly turning back to have another look at his village, not knowing whether he would ever be able to return","9916":"\u201d Barkat\u2019s 65-year-old father, like his son, works as a daily-wage labourer to help the family in

media marketing and broadcasting, using only his smartphone","9918":"COMPOUNDING PROBLEMSMaulana Fazal Wahab, the chairman of Ranolia tehsil, says more than 60 percent of the roughly 100,000 people of the area have migrated to other areas since 2010","9919":"The migrations took place in the wake of floods in 2010, 2016, 2019, 2022 and, most recently, in April this year, following heavy rainfall and flooding that, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) KP, claimed 63 lives in the province","9920":"It is not just torrential rains that disrupt and imperil life in these areas","9921":"Landslides are known to cause fatal accidents and, in the wake of rising global temperatures, the threat of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) has also emerged in KP and Gilgit Baltistan (GB)","9922":"The ministry of climate change says glaciers in the country\u2019s northern mountain ranges (the Hindu Kush, Himalayas and Karakorum) are melting rapidly","9923":"A total of 3,044 glacial lakes have developed in GB and KP","9924":"While glacial lakes may have been forming over geological timescales, their rapid proliferation and expansion in Pakistan are more closely associated with the past century or so, particularly as global temperatures have risen","9925":"\u201cOf these, 33 glacial lakes have been assessed to be prone to hazardous GLOF,\u201d the ministry writes on its website","9926":"It claims more than seven million people, in the two regions, are vulnerable to the dangers posed by GLOF","9927":"This compounds the concerns of the locals, including in various areas of Lower Kohistan \u2014 such as Ranolia, Dubair Bala and Dubair Khas \u2014 where flash floods have become more frequent","9928":"The flooding also damages bridges and river crossings, disconnecting the valley from the Karakoram Highway and greatly limiting access and the mobility of the local population","9929":"Wahab, the tehsil chairman, says a 37-kilometre stretch of the Ranolia-Dubair main road and the roads in the Ranolia valley have been completely washed away by the floods several times","9930":"\u201cPeople have no choice but to leave the area, because life comes to a complete standstill [in the wake of such disasters],\u201d he tells Eos","9931":"Barkat says that, during such situations, the locals are often left with no choice but to reconstruct and repair the roads and bridges on a self-help basis","9932":"\u201cHowever, it is unfair to expect from people \u2014 who have lost everything including their home, land and livelihood \u2014 to contribute to road repair under such circumstances,\u201d he says","9933":"UPENDED LIVES Muhammad Riaz, a teacher, lived a happy life with his wife and eight children","9934":"He had a 12-room house on a terraced mountain along the Dubair River","9935":"During the floods in April, the torrential rains triggered landslides and his house caved in in a matter of minutes","9936":"\u201cMy world has completely collapsed,\u201d he tells Eos","9937":"\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a house for me","9938":"It was the centre of my dreams","9939":"\u201d He says his family has no option but to leave","9940":"But with exits from the village, including pedestrian paths, yet to be repaired, he has chosen to stay in the area for the time being and not risk \u201cthe treacherous terrain\u201d with his young family","9941":"Riaz says that, in order to buy essentials, he has to walk for seven hours to the market in Ranolia \u2014 with the journey including parts that require a steep upward climb","9942":"He says the situation is desperate, with food and water shortage rampant","9943":"He is also worried about his children and the uncertain future facing them","9944":"\u201cThey want to go to school, but there is no means of getting there,\u201d he says","9945":"\u201cEvery day I tell them that everything is going to be okay","9946":"But deep down, I know that we are all on a long and hard road, and that this road has no end in sight","9947":"\u201d Healthcare is the other major casualty, particularly during calamities in far-flung and smaller areas","9948":"The public health centres, including the rural health centre and basic health units, were damaged last month and are out of commission","9949":"Patients from across the valley have to be carried \u2014 mostly on makeshift wooden stretchers locally known as dangai \u2014 to the sole privately operated hospital in the main town of Dubair","9950":"At a large number of points, the path is narrow and zigzags a lot","9951":"Sometimes, it can take hours to get the patient, in need of timely medical care, to the hospital","9952":"Yar Gul, from a nearby village, had brought a patient to the hospital","9953":"He says it took him and nearly 20 other relatives around 12 hours to get to the hospital","9954":"A teenage boy, who was hit in the head by a stone, wasn\u2019t so lucky, says Gul","9955":"\u201cHe died during the trip and the family had to return midway","9956":"\u201d NOT UNUSUAL APATHYThe assistant commissioner (AC) of Ranolia, Iqbal Hussain Khattak, says the biggest challenge for people, particularly in villages in the Dubair Valley, is the loss of their crops and the inundation of their agricultural lands","9957":"While crediting his employers, the state, for doing \u201cits part\u201d for the rehabilitation work in Dubair, the bureaucrat acknowledges that more resources and funds are needed, as well as alternative settlements and funds for a road that is constructed at a distance from the river","9958":"The AC says the administration had shifted vulnerable families to government buildings in 2022 and claimed that some of those families were still living there","9959":"\u201cBut the majority have migrated to bigger cities and towns in search of a better life, and to create a distance between them and the areas susceptible to climate-induced

estimated that there are around 113,000 residential units with solar generation equipment installed on their rooftops, along with a net metering connection","10124":"We may call these \u2018distributed generators\u2019","10125":"This is only 0","10126":"3 per cent of total households in the country","10127":"Most units availing net metering facilities have installed capacity greater than five kilowatts, putting them among the more privileged segment of society in the top two electricity consumption slabs","10128":"Lately, there has been noise regarding a change in net metering price \u2014 the price at which an electricity distribution company swaps out the unit generated by a distributed solar generator","10129":"Such a revision in price is being taken as an attack on the country\u2019s middle class","10130":"For a lower to lower-middle-income economy like Pakistan, 0","10131":"3pc of households with net metering connections certainly do not constitute the middle class but are essentially the upper class","10132":"Those belonging to such an economic strata may not feel like it, but the country\u2019s overall distribution of wealth and income says otherwise","10133":"The current net metering price is around Rs22 per kilowatt hour, which is basically higher than the weighted average fuel cost of roughly Rs9 per kilowatt hour","10134":"In a scenario where excess generation capacity is available, it makes little sense to generate electricity via distributed solar at such a high cost","10135":"It also doesn\u2019t make sense to add more utility-scale solar, where the price is higher than the average generation cost","10136":"Current electricity pricing regime subsidises wealthy, solar power generating households while shifting cost burden on the grid-dependent citizensThe final tariff paid by a household is high and is a function of variable costs, capacity costs, transmission and distribution costs, losses, and a plethora of taxes","10137":"This has led to demand destruction, compounding problems in the process","10138":"A uniform tariff that socialises losses is a bad policy regardless","10139":"Similarly, a policy subsidising the upper class at the cost of everyone else is also bad","10140":"The current electricity pricing regime is on a cost-plus basis, which means capacity charges for generation and transmission assets are essentially spread over generated electricity units","10141":"It is suboptimal at best and needs to be amended on a priority basis","10142":"As net metering results in reduced demand from the grid, the residual units of electricity generated have a higher capacity cost component, which is paid by the remaining users on the grid","10143":"A contrarian argument here is that households that generate electricity through rooftop solar also carry the burden of capacity costs of the grid since the same households use electricity from the grid when the sun sets or when solar generation declines","10144":"The grid acts as a backup or secondary source of power for such households, and hence, a fair price must be paid for having access to a backup","10145":"An argument that is given by proponents of a high net metering price (that benefits solar-generating households) is that households had invested in solar generation equipment","10146":"Hence, they should be allowed to recover their investment","10147":"The current net metering price is around Rs22 per kilowatt hour, much higher than the weighted average fuel cost of roughly Rs9 per kilowatt hourThere is no reason why a government should backstop losses or guarantee paybacks when no such explicit contract is in place","10148":"Even the distributed generation concurrence that is executed between the household and distribution company clearly states that the net metering tariff is bound to revision","10149":"Such revision should reflect economic realities rather than backstopping payback periods for a few thousand households","10150":"Any policy intervention to adjust net metering prices must be designed carefully, and socio-economic realities must also be considered","10151":"As net metering users rely on the grid as a secondary generation source, they also should contribute towards capacity payments on a pro-rata basis","10152":"The same can be achieved by having a fixed cost corresponding to kilowatts installed by each household","10153":"Only those households that have solar generation units of five kilowatts and above can be covered within such a structure, wherein a fixed component of tariff can be introduced linked to installed capacity","10154":"Similarly, the net metering price can be linked with the average generation cost, which can be adjusted as overall pooled costs change","10155":"Through such a manoeuvre, it will be possible to reduce losses the grid has to suffer, and the excess cost that has to be absorbed by the more vulnerable and protected segments","10156":"As protected segments, and other consumer categories also benefit from a cross-subsidy provided by commercial and industrial users, this can also reduce the same in the process","10157":"The policy needs to be designed to discourage investment in distributed energy and not burden other users solely by relying on the grid","10158":"Given a global surplus capacity, as the price of solar panels continues to decline, the market will continue to gravitate towards the addition of more solar generation","10159":"Similarly, as the storage cost rapidly declines, it will get increasingly cheaper to move completely off-grid","10160":"Any policy that does not consider the changing economic realities of reducing storage and generation costs will compound losses for the grid in the future","10161":"The policy needs to be future-oriented, where distributed generation is fairly priced rather than serving the interests of a few thousand households to the detriment of millions","10162":"Ammar H Khan is an Assistant Professor of Practice at the Institute of Business Administration, KarachiPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, May 13th,

working mother","10250":"\u201cI think that there\u2019s a lot of mum guilt, especially because everything gets posted on social media and you worry that you may not have done enough for your child","10251":"\u201cIt\u2019s an Instagram world and you may have spent an hour decorating a basket for your child\u2019s school activity while other parents may have invested an entire day into it","10252":"And even though your child is happy, you start fretting that, perhaps, I should have made a better costume, or created a better basket","10253":"\u201cAlso, people judge very

lot of my friends would constantly be meeting and I wouldn\u2019t be able to, because I was at work","10261":"I have been very lucky \u2014 I love what I do and everyone around me has been very supportive","10262":"\u201dMaliha seems to have inherited a similar love for the brand","10263":"I reminisce about how FTA initially started making waves on social media with the aid of creative campaigns, celebrity collaborations and fun behind-the-scenes (BTS) footage from shoots","10264":"Maliha says: \u201cI love marketing, I\u2019ve studied it too","10265":"We started coming up with BTS content back when very few people were doing it, and I enjoy curating campaigns for new collections","10266":"But I do think that what I enjoy the most is the designing process","10267":"I know that it\u2019s important to keep an eye on profits and set targets, but we have people who worry about all this","10268":"If I started thinking about finances all the time, I feel that my creativity would suffer","10269":"And my mum\u2019s the same","10270":"\u201dLike mother, like daughter","10271":"A love for design binds Farah Talib Aziz and Maliha Aziz together as does their love for each

blocked immediately by the security forces\u201d","10332":"Bamiyan, home to the giant Buddhas blown up by the Taliban in 2001, is Afghanistan\u2019s top tourist destination","10333":"The Taliban

April of the previous year, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday","10344":"The current account surplus in March amounted to $434m, showing a positive trend","10345":"The latest SBP data shows that the current account deficit (CAD) narrowed by 95 per cent to just $202m in the first 10 months of FY24","10346":"This significant reduction indicates that the CAD is heading towards a negligible amount for FY24, providing substantial relief for the government amidst mounting pressure for foreign debt servicing","10347":"Details reveal that the CAD during July-April amounted to $202m, a stark contrast to the $3","10348":"92 billion recorded during the same period in FY23","10349":"Deficit narrows 95pc to $202m in July-April period of FY24This achievement is particularly noteworthy for the government, which faces the daunting task of arranging $25bn for debt servicing in FY25","10350":"The government is making efforts to secure an $8bn loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), potentially opening up other avenues for inflows, similar to the $3bn Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) finalised at the beginning of FY24","10351":"The significant reduction in the imports bill during the current fiscal year has been the primary driver behind the support provided to the current account surplus","10352":"However, analysts have expressed doubt regarding the discrepancy between import reductions reported by the SBP and those reported by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS)","10353":"According to data released by the PBS, imports declined by 4","10354":"09pc to $44","10355":"79bn in the July-April compared to $46","10356":"70bn in the same period of FY23","10357":"Pakistan\u2019s trade deficit decreased by 18pc to $19","10358":"5bn during July-April FY24, mainly due to the reduction in imports and an increase in exports, compared to a trade deficit of $23","10359":"53bn during the same period in FY23","10360":"Analysts said the current account surplus would help the country to improve its ratings from international rating agencies","10361":"Most of the international rating agencies kept Pakistan at the lowest level, particularly when the country was close to sovereign default at the end of June 2023","10362":"Published in Dawn, May 18th, 2024","10363":"Agriculture is a key contributor to Pakistan\u2019s economy, but its growth is declining","10364":"Nationally, agriculture accounts for 22","10365":"7% of Pakistan\u2019s GDP, employs 37","10366":"4% of the labour force, and directly and indirectly accounts for nearly 80% of the total value of Pakistan\u2019s exports","10367":"Yet, the sector\u2019s growth has declined from 3","10368":"3% during 2001-2010 to 2","10369":"4% in 2011-2022","10370":"Growth in any economic sector depends largely on the strength of its research and innovation (R&I) system","10371":"This article highlights agricultural R&I\u2019s main achievements as well as the gaps that are hindering its ability to deliver faster growth, create resilience for climate change and deliver food and nutritional security","10372":"Traceability and Sustainability\nEstablished in the late 19th century, Pakistan\u2019s R&I system is one of the oldest in the Subcontinent, and although it has expanded horizontally over the years to cover almost all agricultural commodities, ecoregions and disciplines, there has been little integration within and across research institutes and universities","10373":"Both provincial research institutes and extensions come under the provincial agriculture departments, but they work almost independently","10374":"Similarly, the federal research institutes on agriculture and water, which work on high-end strategic issues, have little integration with the relevant provincial institutes","10375":"Furthermore, agricultural universities have hardly any links with either federal or provincial research institutes, while the private sector focuses mainly on promoting their own products and has few opportunities to collaborate with the public sector R&I system","10376":"According to a survey conducted in 2020, over 43,000 professionals and support staff are engaged in public sector agriculture R&I in Punjab and Sindh","10377":"About 31% are engaged in research and the remaining 69% are in agricultural extension (taking technologies to the relevant stakeholders); 61% of these resources are employed in crops and 39% in livestock, even though the contribution of the two sectors in GDP is the reverse","10378":"The R&I system is highly bureaucratic, as all scientific staff are supported by six non-professional and administrative staff members","10379":"The female strength is less than 10%","10380":"Estimates for 2018 suggest that Rs 10","10381":"8 billion were spent on crop R&I in Punjab and Sindh","10382":"Investments by the private sector in research is relatively small compared to other developing countries; although lately it has released some useful varieties of cotton and potato","10383":"Successes and Achievements\nPakistan\u2019s R&I system has been successful in generating new crop varieties, developing vaccines and diagnostic kits for major animal diseases, and producing and disseminating information and knowledge with respect to crop varieties and animal vaccines","10384":"Between 1947 and 2020, 923 crop varieties were developed, although most remained on the shelf and only a few reached the farmers\u2019 fields","10385":"About 95% of these varieties were developed by the public sector","10386":"Although some varieties were developed for high-value crops like fruits, vegetables, pulses, oilseeds and floriculture, little emphasis was put on promoting these varieties to the farmer","10387":"The release of crop varieties with higher-yield potential and new sources of pest resistance and tolerance has increased per-hectare farm yields for major crops by over three times since 1947","10388":"This has not only contributed to improving agriculture\u2019s GDP; it has also helped farmers adapt to emerging climate stresses, enhance the nutrient content of food and prevent the widespread outbreaks of various diseases","10389":"It has also enhanced the per capita availability of food","10390":"For example, the annual per capita availability of wheat from domestic production has gone from 85 kilos in 1960 to 115 kilos in 2021","10391":"In other words, since 1947, the R&I system has not only fed five times more people; it has also fed them better","10392":"During this period, the government built dams, installed tube wells, provided incentives for the purchase of tractors and promoted the local fertiliser industry, inducing higher land-use intensity and increasing crop production, especially in Punjab and Sindh","10393":"A recent success of the R&I system has been the phenomenal increase in maize production, a development attributed to the introduction of hybrid seeds along with improved management practices by the private sector","10394":"The spectacular growth in the poultry sector during the last three decades has also been a great achievement of the system, replacing the consumption of expensive red meat and helping overcome protein deficiency in the population","10395":"This is mainly attributed to the introduction of new poultry breeds (PIA-Shaver), the promotion of state-of-the-art poultry sheds, the wider availability of poultry feeds, an improved regulatory framework, the availability of poultry vaccines, and the promotion of associated management practices","10396":"There have been some recent successes in fruit, vegetable and oilseed production, although it is still not certain whether these yields will be sustainable over a longer period of time","10397":"For example, a 100% increase in potato production and a 133% increase in potato exports between 2016 and 2022 are attributed to the introduction of hybrid potato seeds suitable for processing, associated management practices and the presence of a small-scale processing industry in the private sector","10398":"Yields for peaches and guavas increased by 80% and 70%, respectively, between 2017 and 2021","10399":"The production of fodder crops has quadrupled, while that of rapeseed and mustard, especially canola, has increased by 150% during the same period","10400":"However, crops like cotton remained in crisis, while the per-hectare and per-animal yields of major crops like wheat and rice remained stagnant over the period","10401":"Issues\nAlthough the system did bring about significant positive outcomes in terms of meeting Pakistan\u2019s growing food requirements, it has failed to make the agri sector market competitive by enabling its stakeholders to respond to changing demands in the quality of agriculture products","10402":"Pakistan is losing big opportunities by not participating in the fast-expanding international fruit and vegetable market, which totals over $275 billion, while Pakistan\u2019s share of it is about 0","10403":"1%","10404":"This situation has been partly due to a lack of resources and partly to poor management in the R&I system","10405":"Only approximately 0","10406":"23% of the GDP from the crop sector is invested in R&I (the norm is 1","10407":"0%), compared to 0","10408":"35% in Bangladesh, 0","10409":"6% in China and 0","10410":"45% in India","10411":"More important than the lack of funds is the failure of R&I to develop effective planning and inter- and intra-institution coordination mechanisms that would involve private sector stakeholders, including producers, thereby ensuring an efficient use of scarce resources to meet market demands","10412":"As a result, R&I is a supply-driven, rather than demand-oriented, system in terms of addressing issues","10413":"For example, despite the increasing demand for value-added and processed products, R&I activities are mostly confined to farm production issues without sufficient emphasis on value chain development","10414":"R&I is tightly controlled administratively and financially by federal and provincial bureaucracies and has little autonomy to mobilise or allocate human or financial resources on a need basis","10415":"Over 90% of the budget goes into paying salaries, with very little left to carry out research","10416":"Training opportunities are few and international collaborations have almost dried out","10417":"There are no incentives for researchers to develop patented products, as they have no share in the proceeds","10418":"Agriculture extension is still largely based on personal contacts and it is almost impossible to individually reach the growing number of small farmers","10419":"Modern approaches to extension that involve the private sector and reaching out to farmers are either missing or ineffective","10420":"It is worth noting that the most successful R&I systems in the world have been largely made autonomous by involving stakeholders and the private sector in research planning, funding and product dissemination","10421":"Lack of Reform and Impact\nDue to the lack of reform in agricultural R&I over the last three decades, performance is at a low ebb","10422":"Although the system is still as good as similar systems in, for example, Brazil, India or Mexico, when it comes to generating outputs like research papers and varieties, the outcomes are poor because they are either not relevant or not communicated to the stakeholders","10423":"The consequences of this disconnect are serious","10424":"Firstly, despite the introduction of new varieties and technologies, the per-hectare and per-animal yields of most crops and livestock are lower than the world average, despite the fact that Pakistan has one of the best alluvial soils and irrigation systems in the world","10425":"As a consequence, agricultural commodities have lost their competitiveness","10426":"It is estimated that if farm-level yields were brought to par with world-average levels, this would add $10 billion annually to our agriculture sector","10427":"Secondly, R&I has failed to diversify to meet national and international demands for nutrition-rich and high-value products","10428":"The focus has been on major crops, with little emphasis on fruit, vegetables, oilseeds, and pulses","10429":"As a result, Pakistan is spending $7","10430":"3 billion annually on importing food items, including $3","10431":"2 billion on edible oil, $0","10432":"75 billion on pulses, and $0","10433":"5 billion on tea","10434":"Thirdly, we have lost competitiveness at the secondary level because of the lack of investment in improving the value chain of primary farm products","10435":"The R&I system has been unable to introduce economically viable technologies for the value addition of local products, with the result that the quality of Pakistan\u2019s produce does not match the demand from national and international markets","10436":"This is reflected in the fact that almost all exportable agricultural commodities fetch prices that are lower than the world average","10437":"Fourthly, little agricultural produce goes into processing","10438":"Unlike in China, Vietnam, and many other countries, we have largely failed to bring about a \u2018small-scale\u2019 industrial revolution, thus unable to generate new job and income opportunities for the rural poor","10439":"Overall, the inefficient and irrelevant R&I system has failed to tackle poverty, overcome nutrient deficiencies, and handle climate change impacts","10440":"It is estimated that if the quality of Pakistan\u2019s agricultural products is on par with the world average, Pakistan would be earning an additional $10 billion annually and creating millions of new jobs in rural and peri-urban areas","10441":"Moving Forward\nThere is significant potential in the agriculture sector to enable the creation of new jobs, enhance incomes and foreign exchange earnings, and support the industry","10442":"However, to do so, the R&I system has to abandon its archaic, traditional system and move towards meeting the demand for \u2018knowledge-based\u2019 agricultural growth that responds to and fosters interaction among all stakeholders \u2013 universities, research, extension, producers, traders, and value-chain managers \u2013 in the public and private sectors, as well as keeping abreast of advances in modern research and management systems and changing demands","10443":"The immediate issue is not funding","10444":"It is about improving R&I planning, coordination and monitoring mechanisms in order to better utilise the available resources in high-impact areas","10445":"Nine Ways to Boost Pakistan\u2019s R&I System:1","10446":"Pluralistic:  Develop partnerships with different players, including the private sector","10447":"2","10448":"Diverse:  Address value chain issues and include agribusinesses, the food industry, policymakers, environmental groups and

corporal punishment of madrassa students are neither new discoveries, nor particular to Pakistan","10477":"Globally, totalitarian institutions \u2014 seminaries, the Vatican, and even lay establishments like boarding schools, military barracks, orphanages, and shelters \u2014 have long records of systemic abuse","10478":"However, the power of clerical lobbies in Pakistan often secures impunity for religious institutions and only the high risks taken by whistleblowers, fearless activists, and survivors result in any kind of justice","10479":"Unfortunately, over the past 20 years, the more temporal approaches to social development in Pakistan have been displaced by a generation convinced that sacralising development is appropriate for Muslim sensibilities","10480":"This has complicated pre-existing challenges in Pakistan\u2019s colonial and Islamic hybrid legal regime, deepened the shame and stigma associated with concepts of gender and sex, and privileged clerical authority over human rights advocacy","10481":"According to data gathered by Sahil, an NGO working on cases of child sexual abuse, the overwhelming majority of abusers are acquaintances or neighbours in communities or family members","10482":"At the same time, the data also shows that institutionally, the highest number of complaints emerge against religious teachers or clerics \u2014 more so than police, school-teachers, or nuclear family members","10483":"In 2020, the Associated Press documented several cases of sexual abuse in madrassas, including the case of 8-year-old Yaous in Mansehra, where despite the arrest of the offender, Qari Shamsuddin, fellow clerics and worshippers at the mosque disputed the charges, terming him innocent and a \u2018victim of anti-Islamic elements in the country\u2019","10484":"The cleric was later sentenced to 16","10485":"5 years imprisonment","10486":"Primary data remains limited and organisations rely on media reports and police complaints but the trend over the past 20 years shows the gender divide of abused girls in madrassas is slightly higher than that of boys (\u2018Cruel Numbers\u2019)","10487":"The recent case of Qari Abubakar Muaviyah\u2019s alleged rape of a 12-year-old boy in Shahdara initially looked like a lost cause due to the usual clerical pressure for the survivor to resile","10488":"Under the amended anti-rape law, the police and prosecutors are duty bound to continue investigation and judicial hearing, even if the survivor resiles, yet they prefer compromises","10489":"The difficulty of obtaining DNA forensics is another escape route in many cases","10490":"In the end, it was only social media pressure over the Muaviyah case that resulted in a political and legal response against powerful religious lobbies","10491":"Over the years, there have also been several reports of gang rapes in such seminaries","10492":"In very rare cases do children fight their rapists off and where parents are resilient in their pursuit for justice","10493":"Historically, Pakistani madrassas have been subject to cycles of reorganisation and reform but only over curricula or funding and not institutional accountability","10494":"In 2003, at the peak of the \u2018war on terror\u2019, a new form of war anthropology and research methods emerged, relying on fixers, handlers, translators, NGO research and No Objection Certificates awarded by the military authorities at their discretion","10495":"This new paradigm produced a body of newly minted \u2018experts\u2019 on Islam, terrorism, jihad, security and conflict studies and now, Islam and development, as funded by British and American governments under the pretext of Muslim exceptionalism (especially, Muslim women and the poor)","10496":"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) implemented a five-year, $100 million bilateral agreement in 2002","10497":"Another multi-million pound religions and research project was spearheaded by DFID in 2008, paving the way for faith-based approaches to social change in Pakistan","10498":"With the help of overseas Pakistani consultants, they found that religion can be valuable in terms of providing organisational resources for social movements, with religious leaders and Muslim NGOs as \u2018partners\u2019","10499":"Policy briefs from such projects stressed on the need to review and include religion into the mainstream of development research and policy itself, including support to madrassas and to encourage women\u2019s religious leadership as alternatives to Western feminism","10500":"At the time, Gen Musharraf\u2019s US-compliant government was facing domestic resistance for registering madrassas as suspected support bases and havens for terrorists","10501":"The top-down consultant policy briefs insisted on the kind of reform that was acceptable to the undefined \u201cUlema\u201d and ignored the experiences of civil society on the subject by dismissing any critique of faith-based development by feminists as \u2018western and liberal-secular orientalism\u2019","10502":"The experts producing such research rode the crest of Gen Musharaff\u2019s duplicitous project of enlightened moderation and recommended the inclusion of madrassas and clerical leaders into the social development sector","10503":"Even those claiming radical credentials, and who were critical of the binaries of western secular departure from religious-based education, invested hope in the role of madrassas as some decolonising, non-Western social safety nets for children from impoverished backgrounds and in women\u2019s empowerment through mosque and madrassa piety","10504":"These researchers and studies completely ignored \u2014 as some orientalist presumption \u2014 the history of corporal punishment and child sexual abuse at mosques and madrassas that human rights activists had been documenting for at least a decade","10505":"This was a revealing and damaging missed opportunity","10506":"This \u2018partnership\u2019 between donors and clerics has empowered the latter as community gate-keepers (especially, in projects related to education, vaccination, child protection committees and labour)","10507":"Recent cases have shown, however, that some of these clerics, who are now power brokers, may pressurise victims to resile charges of sex abuse in communities and madrassas, and who facilitate compromise and settling cases outside of courts, especially when it involves fellow clerics","10508":"Research studies, academic theses and donor reports continue to recommend that Pakistan\u2019s government should make genuine efforts to understand how the madrassa leadership perceives reform and modernisation, and for involvement in social development projects without any caution for regulation of widespread allegations of physical or sexual abuses","10509":"Every other sector of reform is subjected to correction as a constitutional and moral imperative (especially, the \u2018corrupt\u2019 bureaucracy and judiciary) but the one sector where appeasement by government and donors remains consistent is religion and its institutional influence","10510":"This extends and sustains moral and legal impunity to the priestly classes and prevents rights-based progress","10511":"In the first instance, legal reform has managed to chip at some religious exemption by way of releasing rape and honour crimes from the Qisas and Diyat loophole","10512":"It took 30 years of consistent advocacy from women\u2019s rights activists and not the route of some decolonial thesis, nor due to reinterpretive exegesis","10513":"The amendments to many discriminatory laws have been rationalised by liberal appeal and universalising influences within the Constitution and while some opportunist clerics and politicians have been \u2018encouraged\u2019 to curb their opposition, this does not count as \u2018success\u2019 of ecclesiastical partnerships","10514":"Secondly, many gender and religious biases are underwritten in family laws which prevent consensus or consistency on matters of sexual maturity and underage marriage","10515":"Over 18 per cent of girls and 4 pc of boys in Pakistan are married before the age of 18 and prevention is complicated by our dual legal regime and by societal trends of forced conversions of girls from religious minorities","10516":"If marriage remains an unequal legal arrangement for all women, and an economic safety net for the poor and a social status for the rich, girls will remain devalued for just their labour and reproductive worth and their virginities and sexual purity will serve as premiums","10517":"Third, overwhelmingly, cases of any but especially child sexual abuse continue to be subject to attrition where survivors or victims\u2019 families resile under counsel and social pressure from community, police or clerical leaders","10518":"As human rights lawyers point out, as long as the judicial process privileges ocular evidence over corroborative forms and courts are unwilling to try cases despite resiling, sex crimes will not be subject to justice","10519":"Beyond legal recourse, social protection for Pakistani children remains precarious due to misguided beliefs and flawed remedies","10520":"The first myth that family, marriage, and community are safe havens encourage private settlements in sex abuse cases and perpetuate lifelong generational trauma","10521":"The second damaging myth is that biology is the driver of sexual violence instead of unequal power relations, especially between genders","10522":"Feminists have countered both these fallacies","10523":"They refute the notion that sex abuse is a private matter by insisting that the personal is political and risk their lives to speak out on the commonality of violence in families and marriages","10524":"The Aurat March movement has expanded this cause with many members narrating their own experiences of sexual offences and providing ventilation for other survivors","10525":"Stigmatising sex education, or underplaying abuse on the pretext of immorality or false respectability, disarms the potential victim from self-defence \u2014 silence and shame is the paedophile\u2019s best alibi","10526":"Glorifying the virtues of domesticated pious women and obedient children justifies discipline and decision-making as the male guardian\u2019s natural right","10527":"Feminists contend that it is not biology but elite capture of social, economic, political resources that buys impunity for powerful abusive men","10528":"They also point out that while there is significant challenge in addressing attitudes within clerical, judicial, and political circles where some may justify male privilege, dismiss allegations of sex crimes, or blame victims, such figures often remain in positions of leadership and trust","10529":"Despite these conceits of legal, social and sexual inequalities, the self-defeating solutions continue to fixate on laws, liberation theology, and male allies \u2014 but each needs reconsideration","10530":"Pakistan has no standard legal definition of a child \u2014 ages for voting, marriage, sex crime, factory work, succession age, or as a juvenile liable to criminal proceedings \u2014 vary considerably across the country and provinces","10531":"Addressing sex crimes either involves deferring responsibility to communities and families, which may perpetuate abuse, or relying on technological solutions as a last resort","10532":"There are at least 17 officially listed helplines for children-related complaints, yet members of Sahil say that hardly any child uses the helplines to complain (it is mostly parents or other adults who use the referral system)","10533":"The high profile and politicised Zainab Alert App for missing children offers lopsided results nationwide and reports more abduction of boys than girls in every province, offering no analysis","10534":"Most laws and policies on women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights are missing data or evaluation, yet random remedies continue to sink the

the constitution to mean that the votes of the members of the parliament\/assemblies cannot be counted if they did not vote along party lines","10614":"At the time of Bandial\u2019s \u2018interpretation\u2019 in 2022, the article prescribed that defecting members could be de-seated post-facto, but their votes were to be counted","10615":"But Justice Bandial, in his verdict, went beyond interpreting an article \u2014 he actually changed its function","10616":"This is akin to rewriting the Constitution","10617":"According to professor of law Randal N M Graham, \u201cA judge\u2019s only goal in the interpretation of statutes is to apply the will of the legislative author","10618":"When carrying out their interpretive task, judges must set aside their own political preferences and disregard their personal ideologies","10619":"Judicial interpreters should be governed by the author of the legislative text, carrying out the will of parliament","10620":"\u201d \n \nSo, Bandial\u2019s verdict was not about what the legislative authors of 63-A had meant","10621":"The verdict was about what 63-A\u00a0ought\u00a0to mean","10622":"Only elected assemblies having legislative authority can change the meaning of a statute","10623":"According to the legal scholar Peter Hogg, \u201cA judge has a great deal of discretion in interpreting the law in the constitution, and the process of interpretation can inevitably remake the constitution in the likeness of the judge","10624":"\u201dRecent judicial activism maintains the precedents set by now-retired populist judges, whose various verdicts badly disturbed the country\u2019s politics, economics and judicial systemAlthough Graham believes this is too bleak a view, he agrees that there is ample empirical evidence to substantiate it","10625":"In Pakistan, this was visible during the long era of \u2018populist\u2019 CJPs","10626":"These included Iftikhar Chaudhry (2009-13), Saqib Nasir (2016-19), Gulzar Ahmad (2019-22) and Bandial (2022-23)","10627":"In his 1996 book\u00a0Overcoming Law, the American legal expert Richard A Posner wrote that a judge\u2019s decisions are sometimes influenced by a desire to become popular","10628":"This was particularly prominent in the conduct of Iftikhar Chaudhry and Saqib Nisar","10629":"The four mentioned judges were also often alleged to have become part of a \u2018popular project\u2019 by the military establishment (ME) to undermine elected governments headed by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)","10630":"The project\u2019s aim was to facilitate the rise of Imran Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)","10631":"These judges took \u2018populist\u2019 stands that included suo moto actions to regulate prices of onions and mangoes and to stop certain privatisation programmes that eventually cost the state billions of rupees","10632":"And they readily heard petitions filed against the PPP and PML-N regimes, even those based on feeble conspiracy theories","10633":"But it was during Nisar\u2019s tenure that the judiciary really began being perceived by anti-PTI parties as becoming fully embedded in the ME\u2019s \u2018Imran Khan project","10634":"\u2019 This perception was also visible during the Bandial tenure even though, by then, the ME had begun to distance itself from the project due to certain disastrous economic and foreign policy blunders made by the Khan regime","10635":"The era of populist CJPs in Pakistan clearly reflects observations made by Posner regarding factors that can influence the verdicts of a judge","10636":"These include: gratitude to the appointing authorities, irritation with or even a desire to undermine a judicial colleague, not wanting to disagree with people one likes, reluctance to offend one\u2019s spouse or close friends, and racial or class solidarity","10637":"All the mentioned CJPs were influenced by some or all of these factors, but let\u2019s focus on Bandial, who was perhaps the last of the judges of the populist era in Pakistan\u2019s judiciary","10638":"He was clearly \u2018irritated\u2019 by Justice Isa and continued to undermine him","10639":"In this, Bandial was toeing the line drawn by the previous ME, which wanted Isa out because he had begun to be seen as a threat to the Khan government and was \u2018too idealistic","10640":"\u2019 The subtext of the latter mainly meant he was too rigidly tied to the Constitution","10641":"Bandial was heavily dependent on \u2018likeminded\u2019 judges to ward off the threat posed by Isa","10642":"Bandial went out of his way to appease colleagues who supported him","10643":"He packed the benches with these judges","10644":"One of Posner\u2019s factors of influence, \u201creluctance to offend one\u2019s spouse or close friends\u201d, is most interesting, suggesting that this is a universal trait in some \u2018biased\u2019 judges","10645":"There is now enough evidence to claim that the families of populist judges had played an emotional role in influencing the judges to tilt their verdicts in favour of Khan and his party","10646":"More interesting, though, seems to be the fact that, even after the Khan project collapsed in April 2022, and after Bandial\u2019s retirement, the larger judiciary has continued to lean towards Khan and his party","10647":"The influence of families could still be a factor","10648":"But what about the judges who weren\u2019t overtly pro-Khan","10649":"Many of them have now decided to favour him","10650":"Khan\u2019s core constituency is made up of the social classes that the judges come from","10651":"Perhaps class sympathy, too, can be a reason for this turn","10652":"The current batch seems to have begun to use cases against Khan and his party members as a way to demonstrate the \u2018independence of the judiciary","10653":"\u2019\u00a0This has excited quite a few court journalists and activist-lawyers, because they perceive this as being the \u2018judiciary\u2019s pushback against the meddlesome ME\u2019 \u2014 an ME that now wants to penalise Khan for various violations and is allegedly trying to influence the judges","10654":"Recently, when six high court judges publicly complained about the ME\u2019s meddling, and some Supreme Court justices began to deliver \u2018pro-people\u2019 lectures in the court, it became clear that the non-populist batch has also begun to play in the sphere of judicial populism","10655":"Verdicts authored by them have smacked of judicial activism","10656":"These verdicts have maintained the precedents set by the now-retired populist judges, whose various verdicts badly disturbed the country\u2019s politics, economics and the judiciary itself","10657":"The recent emergence in this respect is being driven by an ideology that is positing itself as a fight for democracy and judicial independence \u2014 but not necessarily for the supremacy of the Constitution","10658":"The emergence, perhaps purposely, is lurching forward to undermine CJP Isa\u2019s insistence on sticking to a faithful reading of the Constitution, rather than interpreting it on the basis of a particular ideology","10659":"He now finds himself between a rock (ME) and a hard place (a new batch of activist judges)","10660":"Published in Dawn, EOS, May 19th, 2024","10661":"Apathy, manipulation and intrigue seem to define Pakistan football","10662":"While players and fans of football continue to rue the state of the sport in the country despite its undoubted popularity, the machinations in its governing body, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), paint a picture of those at the helm working for their own personal interests rather than for the good of its main stakeholders","10663":"But now there seems to be an unholy nexus between such interests and parts of the global football governing body Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as well","10664":"FIFA has suspended the country twice in the last decade alone \u2014 including over interference in the PFF elections","10665":"Eventually, the world governing body resorted to a stopgap solution of appointing a \u201cNormalisation Committee\u201d (NC) in 2019","10666":"It was given the explicit task to hold the PFF elections transparently, while managing football activities, including conducting regular domestic football tournaments, till the appointment of a new governing board","10667":"But even this stopgap solution has now been mired in controversy, with the NC failing woefully short of meeting its mandate and getting multiple extensions to its tenure along the way","10668":"One major criticism against this stopgap NC is that the man steering it \u2014 Pakistani-Canadian tech entrepreneur Haroon Malik \u2014 is trying to set up a franchise league, on similar lines as cricket\u2019s glitzy Pakistan Super League, at the expense of a club-based domestic league necessary for the grassroots development of the sport","10669":"This Eos investigation will reveal how Malik is actively trying to engineer a situation that would enable him to continue exerting his influence over the PFF \u2014 even after his departure following elections for a new governing body \u2014 and how some of the highest-ranking officials in FIFA are part of an elaborate scheme to upend Pakistan football for their own gains","10670":"Everyone agrees that Pakistan football needs a regular league system to provide a platform for local footballers and to capitalise on the growing fan interest in the sport","10671":"But is a franchise system like cricket\u2019s PSL the best way forward","10672":"And why is an interim football administration pushing for it","10673":"FAR FROM NORMALISEDOn a breezy Ramazan night during the second week of March, two football teams took to a ground nestled in the hills to Karachi\u2019s north","10674":"There was an

structure, which can allow local players to have regular competition","10685":"Since taking up the job in October 2023, Constantine has been adamant that a functioning league would allow him to have a greater pool of local players to choose from, instead of working only with those at his disposal at the training camp","10686":"He was merely repeating himself six months on","10687":"He was also critical of the stopgap NC over the delay in organising the National Challenge Cup, an annual month-long football tournament, which was suspended after the group stages in January last year","10688":"For him, the tournament could have been a starting point for the league","10689":"\u201cI just heard there were 5,000 clubs in Pakistan,\u201d he said, referring to the results of the recent club scrutiny \u2014 disputed at several levels \u2014 carried out by the stopgap NC","10690":"\u201cYou don\u2019t need every district to be part of the league","10691":"We had a Challenge Cup

Pakistan football suffers from a multitude of problems: from a decades-long power struggle over control of the federation, including a hostile takeover of its premises in 2021 \u2014 which resulted in a 15-month suspension of Pakistan by FIFA \u2014 to the lack of clarity over whether any future domestic league would be a club or departmental event, or if it would take place at all","10696":"This is aside from national team players often going unpaid for months, and the country\u2019s and clubs\u2019 abysmal performance in international competitions","10697":"The PFF has also failed on the administrative front, with elections for the new governing body not held in the three years since Malik was appointed to lead the stopgap NC","10698":"One of the elections conducted by the stopgap NC, for the referee\u2019s association, remains disputed","10699":"In another controversial decision, the PFF allowed newly registered clubs the right to vote \u2014 against the PFF Constitution \u2014 in the ongoing district elections","10700":"These clubs were scrutinised as part of PFF\u2019s extensive programme to register clubs, the long-delayed first step towards holding elections","10701":"A novel way of voting has also been introduced for the district elections, with votes to be cast through WhatsApp, which has raised further alarm among the footballing community","10702":"There\u2019s a method to the madness, however","10703":"Under the PFF constitution, registered clubs vote for district associations, which in turn vote for the provincial associations","10704":"Three nominees each from the four provinces and one from Islamabad become part of the PFF Executive Committee (ExCo)","10705":"The ExCo, comprising a total of 26 members, votes for the president","10706":"Other relevant associations and groups, like that of the referees, also have one vote as do the eight departmental teams and the club that wins the women\u2019s national championship","10707":"With a simple majority required to win, support from the provinces and Islamabad alone can tip the election in a candidate\u2019s favour","10708":"With clubs \u2014 that had voting rights previously, when the last PFF election was held in 2015 \u2014 set to vote for the stakeholders who have been vying for power for the past several years, detractors have accused the NC of manipulating the still-to-be-held elections by including newly registered clubs","10709":"The extent of the control the Haroon Malik-led governing body holds over the election has resulted in concerns over transparency","10710":"In the meantime, the government has written to FIFA on multiple occasions, most recently in December, calling for a change in the NC over its failure to hold elections within the prescribed time","10711":"Despite the vociferous complaints, FIFA gave Haroon Malik and his team another nine-month extension, in March this year","10712":"To understand why Malik continues to enjoy FIFA\u2019s unwavering support and patronage, we have to rewind back to a year before Malik\u2019s appointment as the NC chairman in January 2021","10713":"In retrospect, this provided the first glimpse of what was at play and how FIFA was committing the biggest foul on Pakistan football","10714":"Malik\u2019s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league, only came to light after he was forced out\nof

to push for its endorsement","10748":"\u201dIt was clear that Malik and his associates didn\u2019t want to come out as rebels","10749":"They wanted to hold the league with the PFF\u2019s blessings, as

league","10754":"Meanwhile, Z2C also had BSports \u2014 a sports app that combined social and data feeds with a livestream of sports events","10755":"It also had digital rights for the Pakistan Super League","10756":"The question being raised is whether Malik\u2019s interest is in putting the affairs of the PFF in order as head of the NC or to push forward the franchise league he is invested in","10757":"Haroon Malik\u2019s Instagram post showing him at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich on December 5, 2019, more than a year before his appointment by FIFA as the NC chairman |

see him hold elections for a new executive committee of the country\u2019s football governing body, means there is a conflict of interest, even if he says that FIFA doesn\u2019t think there is any","10774":"\u201cAnyone associated with football, anywhere in the world, would have some stake in the game,\u201d Haroon told\u00a0Eos\u00a0in April 2021","10775":"\u201cIt is normal, and natural","10776":"You cannot have someone who knows nothing about football, nothing about the market that they are operating in, and be responsible for football","10777":"Employers determine if conflict of interests are potentially troublesome","10778":"FIFA determined that my commercial interests have no conflict with this role [as NC chief]","10779":"If FIFA is okay, then that is the final word","10780":"\u201dIn fact, FIFA did not specifically comment on Haroon\u2019s commercial interests having a conflict with his role, but its spokesperson said that \u201cin\u00a0line with standard

elaborate plans of holding a league, or whether they were investigated during the eligibility checks, but added: \u201cFIFA has no further comment at this stage","10782":"\u201d \n\nTAKING INSPIRATION FROM THE PSLIn 2015, Z2C helped launch the PSL","10783":"Its affiliate, Blitz Advertising, was a broadcasting, live-streaming and a marketing partner for the league","10784":"But the partnership fell apart due to a legal dispute in 2020, with the Pakistan Cricket Board claiming victory in its arbitration proceedings against Blitz over rights fee payments related to the PSL two years later","10785":"Blitz has long harboured hopes of holding a football league on similar lines","10786":"With football being an untapped market in Pakistan, with massive potential returns for the initiators, they aren\u2019t the only ones","10787":"For some time, Badar \u201cBobby\u201d Refaie, the former director marketing of the PCB, seemed to be driving forward Z2C\u2019s football ambitions externally, even though he brushed it off as small talk in a conversation during a PSL match in 2021","10788":"\u201cThey just can\u2019t get it together,\u201d he said","10789":"Badar has been involved in almost every sport \u2014 from organising a tour of hockey legends to Pakistan to the National Volleyball Championships","10790":"\u201cWorking on new ideas, beside PSL for your Sports projects [sic],\u201d he wrote to Merchant on a Facebook post in March 2019, adding three pictures: a group photo of former hockey stars with the chief of army staff, one of himself alongside squash great Jahangir Khan and another of Spanish football legend Carles Puyol waving to crowds at the National Stadium in Karachi, during the final of the 2019 PSL","10791":"Puyol\u2019s visit to Karachi was part of a series of launch events for the World Soccer Stars which, in November 2019, saw him, Brazilian Kaka, Portuguese Luis Figo and Frenchman Nicolas Anelka play two exhibition matches in Pakistan","10792":"Ahead of the PSL final in March that year, TouchSky \u2014 who were also behind the World Soccer Stars event \u2014 had inked a deal with the PFF, which was elected in 2018 following elections conducted on the orders of the Supreme Court and not recognised by FIFA, to organise two leagues: a franchise league and a rebranded version of the Pakistan Premier Football League","10793":"The deal, and their plans, came crashing down when FIFA appointed the NC to oversee football affairs in Pakistan","10794":"TouchSky tried to do a similar deal with the PFF NC of Haroon\u2019s predecessor Humza Khan, but were rebuffed","10795":"ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES","10796":"Haroon Malik\u2019s and Z2C\u2019s plans had already taken off the ground by then","10797":"Visits to both AFC and FIFA had been completed","10798":"And once Humza Khan resigned, Malik\u2019s path to take up the reins of the NC was cleared \u2014 thanks to support from Gallavotti, one of FIFA president Gianni Infantino\u2019s key advisers","10799":"But Malik\u2019s league plans, largely of a closed franchise league \u2014 only came to light after he was forced out of the PFF Headquarters, by a group of football officials led by the former court-elected PFF president, Ashfaq Hussain Shah, who claimed the NC was doing nothing on the election front","10800":"That forcible takeover of PFF headquarters by Shah eventually saw FIFA ban Pakistan for 15 months","10801":"Malik aired his views on franchise leagues after FIFA and UEFA crushed plans for a breakaway European Super League (ESL), which was in many ways akin to the franchise system common in American sports","10802":"\u201cLooking at our club structures and history, there are multiple options here,\u201d Malik expressed on X, while delving into a discussion on the collapsed ESL","10803":"\u201cA hybrid model transitioning into promotion\/relegation makes sense to me","10804":"[America\u2019s] Major League Soccer, [Japan\u2019s] J-League is a good conversation starter","10805":"\u201dMalik expanded on this: \u201cSo many possibilities","10806":"Bottom line \u2014 either one is good for the players","10807":"Get them playing","10808":"Enablers: Fandom, Partnerships and Broadcast","10809":"Not insurmountable","10810":"\u201d When asked why a traditional league model \u2014 which would see the country\u2019s football club culture thrive \u2014 might not be better than a franchise league model for Pakistan, Haroon replied, \u201cWe are a ways away from club licensing, and regulations get stringent everywhere","10811":"\u201dHowever, franchise leagues run for a short period of time, with little time to invest in grassroots football or academies","10812":"Club football, on the other hand, runs through the calendar year, giving players the opportunity to get regular competitive football","10813":"Moreover, club-based leagues have the system of relegation and promotion, which operate on sporting merit, while franchise leagues are closed competitions","10814":"The Major League Soccer (MLS) \u2014 a franchise league system \u2014 has achieved huge popularity in the United States","10815":"The MLS, however, runs like a regular league, filling up a calendar year","10816":"In India, the Indian Super League had to eventually be expanded for it to become the country\u2019s national league","10817":"Its current season, which began in September, will culminate\u00a0in\u00a0May","10818":"Another concern is that franchise teams will take up a sizeable chunk of whatever sponsorship is on offer, leaving nothing for the clubs to fund their\u00a0programmes","10819":"This is already a problem for Pakistani club sides","10820":"With the PPFL largely made up of departments, and with none of the teams fulfilling AFC\u2019s club licensing regulations, Pakistan has been unable to send a representative to continental competitions","10821":"Malik, however, believes that wouldn\u2019t be a concern for potential team owners in the model suggested by him","10822":"\u201cSetting up the commercial model is key, adapted to our local market and the sporting culture here,\u201d he said during that exchange","10823":"\u201cOnce that is done, everything is like Tetris, blocks falling into place","10824":"\u201dMalik\u2019s conviction at that point seemingly stemmed from the fact that his plans were already underway, with FCPK set to take care of fandom and Z2C, with its huge portfolio of clients, making sure of partnerships and broadcast","10825":"But the FIFA suspension broke that acceleration","10826":"When Malik and members of his NC eventually returned after being handed back the PFF premises that had been taken over and the FIFA ban getting lifted in June 2022, they were given a further year to complete the mandate","10827":"The NC was then given another extension until March 2024 and now has until December to complete the process","10828":"Meanwhile, detractors insist that the extensions are part of a larger plan to consolidate Malik\u2019s control of the election process and the federation","10829":"TIME TO TURN A CORNERSuch control over the election is key to bringing the league plan of Malik\u2019s Z2C, Gallavotti and Gai to fruition","10830":"If a candidate they\u2019re backing comes into power, it would be easier to get the league rubber-stamped","10831":"It would also ensure that the new PFF will effectively be run by former employees of Z2C","10832":"\u201cGallavotti and Gai are part of FIFA\u2019s inner circle, closest to Infantino,\u201d one source in the global football body tells\u00a0Eos","10833":"\u201cIf they want the league to happen, it will happen sooner or later","10834":"\u201dFIFA\u2019s aim of appointing the NC was to have transparent elections of the PFF but that now seems to be turning into, in footballing terms, a red card offence","10835":"The global football body can point to the fact that it was during the NC\u2019s tenure that Pakistan got past the first round of World Cup qualifying for the first time in history","10836":"But, even if the league eventually begins, the damage caused to the country\u2019s domestic football scene during the last few years is unforgivable","10837":"Earlier this year, the NC made a point of degrading three top-tier clubs of the country","10838":"When the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) asked for nominees from Pakistan for the inaugural SAFF Club Championship, the NC shortlisted three clubs from Balochistan \u2014 Afghan FC, Muslim FC and Baloch FC \u2014 for the event","10839":"A tournament between the trio was announced to select Pakistan\u2019s representative, but it never took place, as the clubs baulked at the financial guarantees the NC sought from them beforehand","10840":"The NC later stated that the clubs weren\u2019t interested in participating at the SAFF event","10841":"It goes back to what Malik said in that exchange on X about clubs not coming close to meeting licensing regulations","10842":"Constantine, if he stays that long, will in all probability get a league for his players, but it may not be a club-based one","10843":"As far as the clubs in the country are concerned, their fate seems to have been sealed by those in FIFA\u2019s inner circle","10844":"The

more than 150 campuses in the United States for the last three weeks","11007":"It may be one of the largest protests since the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 1960s, which were led mostly by students at US universities","11008":"This protest movement, which has incorporated students, faculty, staff and other supporters, has been germinating since Israel invaded the Gaza strip in October of last year","11009":"The nationwide simmering anger in cities and universities against the genocidal violence has, over the months, led to many teach-ins, rallies and civic actions by groups such as Peace and Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace","11010":"At  universities across the US, the administrations have reacted with hyper surveillance of student groups and faculty members","11011":"Pro-Palestinian student groups were suspended in places such as Harvard University, Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and other colleges","11012":"In the first few weeks of the war, all criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza was deemed \u2018anti-Semitic\u2019 and, in some cases, disciplinary actions were brought against faculty in various universities, including the University of Virginia, Muhlenberg College, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Arizona","11013":"PROTEST ORIGINS AND REPERCUSSIONSThe current series of protests that spread like wildfire across the country started when students set up an encampment at Columbia University\u2019s south lawn the same day \u2014 April 17 \u2014 the university\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, testified to the US Congress","11014":"Shafik was attacked by Republican legislators, who accused her of tolerating \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 on Columbia\u2019s campus by not doing enough to counter those opposing Israel\u2019s war on Gaza","11015":"Her testimony came four months after a similar combative congressional hearing that led to the resignations of the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania","11016":"Perhaps learning her lesson from her colleagues, who had tried to defend freedom of speech on their campuses, Shafiq denounced anti-Semitism, saying it \u201chas no place on our campus","11017":"\u201dThe last few weeks have seen tumult across a large number of universities in the United States and also Europe, as students protest Israel\u2019s genocidal actions in Gaza and demand their educational institutions divest from companies funding Israel\u2019s apartheid against Palestinians","11018":"Do these protests signal a change in Western grassroots sentiment about Palestine and can they make a difference","11019":"The encampments started to be put up on the lawns of Columbia University that very day","11020":"These encampments are temporary communities, consisting of tents and shelters and occupy a particular area as a form of political resistance","11021":"They are like the tents (called shanties) put up during the movement for divestment from South Africa in the 1980s (see companion piece by Hasan Zaidi)","11022":"In solidarity with the tents at Columbia, and despite being constantly threatened by university administrations with disciplinary action, the protests have now spread throughout the country","11023":"Protestors have erected and maintained camps to disrupt \u2018business as usual,\u2019 accusing their administrations of complicity in financing the continuing genocide in Gaza by Israel","11024":"In setting up \u201cliberation libraries\u201d and medical clinics, supplying free food, and encouraging exchange of cross-cultural resistance histories and art, they also envision and enact solidarities crucial in the pursuit of a more egalitarian future","11025":"At Columbia, armed police were used to rout protesting students out of an occupied campus building on May 1 (Hamilton Hall, that was also occupied in 1968 and has, ironically, become part of the university\u2019s lore that celebrates its history in the civil rights movement), and to dismantle the camps","11026":"There were more than 100 arrests on that day","11027":"Similar tactics were used at numerous universities across the US","11028":"For example, on the night of April 30, a pro-Israeli mob of more than 100 attacked the pro-Palestine encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with rods, fireworks and pepper sprays","11029":"Faculty and students in the camp reported that the police arrived after much delay and then did not intervene to stop the mob of attackers for a couple of hours, nor did they provide protection to those barricaded in the tents","11030":"Many were seriously injured","11031":"These various confrontations with the police at universities have led to more than 2,500 arrests (mostly on misdemeanour charges) across the country, and the repercussions against the students may continue over the long term \u2014 suspension, denial of diplomas and degrees, and more serious charges","11032":"These actions have been largely condemned as the curtailment of free speech (an American constitutionally guaranteed right against any government action that may restrict speech) and the principle of academic freedom, which has been strongly defended during the past few months by the American Association of University Professors","11033":"SHIFTING THE MEDIA FOCUS","11034":"This said, there is also a palpable risk","11035":"The legitimate concerns over violence universities and states are unleashing upon their students and citizens may divert focus from the demands of the student protestors themselves","11036":"In this charged atmosphere, the US media has pushed discussions on whether calling for an end to Israel\u2019s aggression can be construed as anti-Semitic, while also discussing the legalities of First Amendment rights and free speech concerns","11037":"These debates, although well meaning, ironically continue to centre the US as the site of political debate and change and, at times, deflect attention from the major catastrophe unfolding in Gaza","11038":"These media representations, at times, may reduce the politics of protest and encampments to an opportunity to reveal the hypocrisy, degeneration, or criticism of America\u2019s domestic politics","11039":"In the process, it undermines the protest organiser\u2019s historical and transnational political orientation","11040":"It may shift focus away from their most central demands of ceasefire, decolonisation and divestment","11041":"Instead, it entraps the discussion, both by those who are for and against the movement, as a form of US exceptionalism","11042":"For example, in recent weeks, when international media reported on mass graves being discovered in Nasser and Al-Shifa hospitals in Gaza, mainstream American media outlets were saturated by protest coverage","11043":"As the beheaded, zip-tied, and decaying bodies of Palestinians were being uncovered in regions repeatedly bombarded using US supplied weapons, the more important question for US primetime television remained whether democratic freedoms and rights that the US prides itself on were under threat, due to either protestors \u2018disrupting\u2019 the educational process or by the police responding to them","11044":"Interestingly, it is a privilege America has historically enjoyed; to maintain its illusory freedom from the violence and oppression that it itself in many cases orchestrates in countries across the world","11045":"This perceived separation, and its underlying rhetoric of exceptionalism, clearly shifts our focus from US complicity in devastating wars to arguments primarily on US political freedoms \u2018at risk","11046":"\u2019However, while the media, politicians and university administrations seek to recreate this narrative of exceptionalism, student protestors have persisted in their efforts to re-centre Palestine as the source of their motivation and subject of their demands","11047":"All distracting questions reporters have posed to protestors in these past weeks are responded to with utmost clarity of political stance and purpose","11048":"The students pivot the conversation back to demands of halting the genocide in Gaza","11049":"Pro-Palestine activists protest outside Columbia University in New York City: the series of protests across the country started when students set up an encampment at Columbia University\u2019s south lawn on April 17 | AFP\nCALLS FOR DIVESTMENTWithin this context, one major demand by student protestors in all locations is to make transparent all university financial holdings and to divest from those companies that assist Israel in its war effort","11050":"This has been succinctly conveyed in the slogan \u201cDisclose, divest: We will not stop","11051":"We will not rest","11052":"\u201dThe demand is linked to the long-term Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, which has been systematically attacked by US politicians, while anti-BDS Laws have been passed by many state legislatures","11053":"For example, in demanding \u201cdivestment from death\u201d by ending contracts with companies supplying the Israel Defence Force\u2019s (IDF) war in Gaza, the student group Palestinian Solidarity Committee at the University of Texas, Austin (a place we know better) has called upon the UT system to sell off its stock in US weapons manufacturers such as the Lockheed Martin Corporation, Raytheon, Northrop Corporation, Boeing, General Dynamics and others that sell arms to the IDF","11054":"Further, the State of Texas has its own investments, which include nearly $100 million in Israeli bonds","11055":"While the student protestors at US universities see the issue of divestment as a practical way to pressure Israel from continuing the war, they are also attacked for being \u2018anti-Semitic\u2019 because these protestors, according to pro-Israel forces in US politics, do not seek divestment from other countries of the world that are also guilty of human rights abuses","11056":"Further, the issue of divestment itself has become complicated due to the very nature of investments in today\u2019s economy","11057":"In the 1980s, at the height of the South Africa campaign, Columbia University, one of the first to respond to student pressure, sold stocks it held in companies such as Coca Cola, Mobil Oil or Ford Motors, for doing business with the apartheid regime","11058":"Today, universities in general do not openly disclose their investments and invest through complicated financial mechanisms","11059":"Brown University, for example, holds more than 90 percent of their funds through outside asset managers who, in turn, invest in general index funds, private equities and hedge funds","11060":"These new forms of holdings make the challenge for the protestors even greater","11061":"Yet they have still succeeded in convincing some universities, such as Brown, to bring the issue to their board to vote on the divestment issue","11062":"Similarly, some universities, such as Northwestern University, Johns Hopkins University, Harvard and the University of Minnesota, have negotiated an arrangement that clears the camps (without violence) while obliging the university to consider the request for divestment from Israel","11063":"In small but sure ways, the movement is gaining traction","11064":"This move toward divestment to pressurise Israel to commit to a ceasefire is also reflected in a shift in contemporary US popular politics","11065":"The strength of the current movement, echoing protests in the US in earlier decades (civil rights, anti-Vietnam War, South African divestment), is also based on coalition building by students who support the Palestinian cause","11066":"Since the 1990s, the broadly connected group Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) has consciously worked with other activists in the environmental movement, with groups against US intervention in Latin America, with those supporting indigenous rights, with critics of the Gulf War, and with civil rights groups defending African American and minority rights","11067":"More specifically, in the past few years, SJP developed a strong working coalition with the Black Lives Matter movement","11068":"THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHTThis solidarity work, which is manifested in more than 200 SJP chapters across the US, now has the support of many such groups during the recent protest","11069":"It is a form of intersectionality that is described by participants as the coming together of a range of political causes, may it be to protect the climate, anti-racism, to critique capitalism or against settler colonialism (indigenous communities)","11070":"Hence, during demonstrations, rallies or encampments, people of different ethnicities, racial heritage, cultures and identity groups have come together to protest the war in Gaza \u2014 they are certainly not monochromatic","11071":"This is a major success of the movement, as it speaks to young people across race, religion, gender identity and class background, those who want to raise their voices for social justice and provide a critique of global power structures that discriminate against the Palestinian people","11072":"Student action continues through the commencement\/graduation ceremonies period, typically organised around this time of the year","11073":"Universities such as Columbia and USC have cancelled university-wide ceremonies fearing student protests","11074":"Other places have increased security and threatened dire actions against those disrupting events","11075":"Some commencement speakers have also withdrawn from their commitment in solidarity with the students","11076":"There have been some protest in almost all places during the ceremonies by pro-Palestinian students, may it be a walk-out from arenas, the unfurling of a Palestinian flag, the raising of slogans, or by their turning their backs on deans or university presidents when they speak","11077":"Eventually, perhaps, various kinds of social pressure, suppression of speech and overt violence may slow the movement","11078":"Furthermore, with summer approaching, many students and faculty may leave campus","11079":"There is also a general fear among the students that discriminatory action may be taken against activists when most eyes are diverted in the middle of the summer months","11080":"As the philosopher Judith Butler reminds us in an exchange on political performances, bodies involved in mass demonstrations experience fatigue, exhaustion and weariness while exposing themselves to police brutality (including exposure to tear gas and rubber bullets) and repression (all of this has been experienced by the students)","11081":"Yet, surely through these negative experiences, certain solidarities are also being formed by the act of sharing, empathy, resilience, kindness and alliance","11082":"A tent in Rafah in the Gaza Strip sprayed with a message of solidarity with pro-Palestine protests at universities: with protests spreading to the UK and Europe, it is clear that an international movement has been triggered | Reuters\nA TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENTBased on the above, these past few weeks, and months, should be counted as an extraordinary victory for the students and their supporters, as they have shaken the university administrations and society in general in a major way, and exposed the underlying violence that these universities, the paragons of free speech and academic freedoms, can unleash and are capable of against their own students and faculty","11083":"An international movement has been triggered, with protests spreading to the UK and Europe, and the question of Palestine linked to Israel\u2019s genocidal ambitions is now part of mainstream discussion in the US, because it can no longer be hidden or censored to the same extent","11084":"In a recent article in the New York Times, Charles Homans and Neil Vigdor reported that there has been an increase in sympathy toward the Palestinian cause in the last decade, from 12 percent sympathetic in 2013 to 27 percent now","11085":"They argue that the shift is reflective of how pro-Palestinian activists have worked to connect the cause to domestic movements in the US, such as Black Lives Matter","11086":"This shift, according to them, is also generational, as those who are 18-29 years old are three times more sympathetic to the Palestinians than those over 65","11087":"How this increasing support translates in the 2024 presidential elections is not very clear","11088":"What is clear, however, is that the US is going through a truly transformative moment, which has major international repercussions","11089":"The intensity of this moment may subside, but the students have surely made people aware of the continued colonial and genocidal policy being practised by Israel, with the support and backing of the US government","11090":"The only way to address this impasse is not by silencing the students but to agree to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and, eventually, through a dignified and just solution of the Palestinian cause","11091":"Shafaq Sohail is a graduate student in the department of anthropology at the

Safdar Hussain\nKarachiPublished in Dawn, May 19th, 2024","11183":"Mother\u2019s Day (arguably the most important \u2018day\u2019 for celebrating a loved one) is around the corner once again \u2014 and for those who have a mother figure present in their lives, the most pressing question is often what to get their mom for Mother\u2019s Day","11184":"Before you grab your wallet and rush to your nearest mall to grab a basic candle and a basic kurta from K\u0336h\u0336a\u0336a\u0336d\u0336i\u0336 a local clothing store, know that we asked a bunch of moms what they really, truly want for Mother\u2019s Day and we have the perfect answers for you","11185":"But, you won\u2019t get them straight away","11186":"First, let us give you a little history lesson on why Mother\u2019s Day is celebrated (just read it, your mom will be proud of you for knowing something)","11187":"In the United States, Mother\u2019s Day falls on the second Sunday of May, every year \u2014 and this year it is on May 12","11188":"Other countries have varying traditions and dates for marking the occasion, but since the US version currently looms over us, and most likely when your mom is expecting her present, we\u2019ll stick to that one","11189":"The idea started in America when a woman, Anna Jarvis, held a small memorial service for her own mother on May 12, 1907, the BBC details","11190":"Shortly after that, most places in the US started celebrating the day, with the US president \u2014 he must\u2019ve really loved his mother \u2014 making it a national holiday in 1914","11191":"Jarvis, however, was super unhappy with how companies began using the day as a money-making scheme and campaigned for the government to remove Mother\u2019s Day from the calendar completely","11192":"Keeping in line with the theme of not getting what you wanted, Jarvis\u2019s campaign against the holiday presumably did not work very well, because more than a century later we\u2019re celebrating the holiday on a completely different continent \u2014\u00a0personally, I find it funny that we\u2019re adhering to the US iteration of the holiday, even though the UK has their own version and they were the ones who colonised us and left us with a plethora of their traditions","11193":"We\u2019re sorry we continue the tradition, Jarvis, we just love our moms","11194":"Given the global popularity of the day, mothers must definitely be an integral pillar of the family, right","11195":"Well, that and the fact that they risk their own lives to bring you into this world and then spend every subsequent moment putting your needs before their own","11196":"So the question remains \u2014 what do we get our moms for Mother\u2019s Day","11197":"What could be possibly good enough for the women who care for us from the get-go and don\u2019t stop until their very last breath","11198":"Here at Images, we thought the solution was simple \u2014 ask the moms what they want","11199":"Revolutionary","11200":"Here\u2019s what moms want for Mother\u2019s Day","11201":"I couldn\u2019t start my research anywhere but my own mother, who has two kids \u2014 my younger brother (19) and me (24)","11202":"Her answer was pretty straightforward, she wanted candles","11203":"This was not the reply I was hoping to hear, so I pushed her for another answer; after all, I had an article to write","11204":"Her second answer was that she wanted us to spend time with her, which pretty much ruined any plans I had of going out that night","11205":"Don\u2019t worry, I will spend a lot of time with her","11206":"While some moms want their children to spend more time with them, other mothers, especially those with younger kids, want some space \u2014 and rightfully so, I mean have you ever spent every single day with a five-year-old","11207":"They talk","11208":"A LOT","11209":"A mother of a four-year-old and an 11-month-old said she would love to check into a hotel with a stunning view, and spend a day being herself \u201cwithout any roles like mother, wife, and sister\u201d","11210":"\u201cI\u2019d get up whenever I want, eat anything I want, and just relax","11211":"I\u2019d like my best friend to be there with me, and chat about everything but kids and husband and home,\u201d she said","11212":"Mothers deserve the rest and relaxation \u2014 fresh white linens, room service, and absolutely no screams, snots or scrapes","11213":"Another mom, with children aged 11, 15 and 16, said she wanted a nice staycation away with the kids, but swiftly added that she would be okay without her children, too","11214":"And, again, we get it, we totally do, anyone would want some time away from the constant barrage of \u201cmom, mom, mom, mom, mom","11215":"","11216":"\u201d","11217":"A mom of a 12 and 16-year-old said she wanted breakfast in bed, a handmade card, a day without household chores and an official holiday from work \u2014 all of this seems achievable, except the last one","11218":"Capitalism will never give in that easily, unfortunately","11219":"However, maybe a sick leave would work","11220":"Even better, blame it on your kid and say they\u2019re sick \u2014 hey, there have to be some perks to having children, and what are children even for if not to use for fake illness so you can enjoy Mother\u2019s Day","11221":"\u201cSomewhere I could just relax and not worry about the kids \u2014 like a girls\u2019 trip but with [the] kids who would be looked after by the nannies,\u201d a mother of a three-year-old and a 10-year-old said","11222":"You know, being a mother is starting to sound a lot like being a 24\/7 nanny","11223":"We really hope this mother gets some help with her kids, even if just for the day","11224":"When we asked a mother of a six and 11-year-old, her answer was short and sweet: \u201cA day off from all responsibilities\u201d","11225":"Given everything mothers do, for not just their kids but their entire family, wanting to do nothing is totally valid","11226":"So, perhaps the perfect gift for your mother would be you picking up the slack and doing some work around the house to offer her respite","11227":"A mom of an eight-month-old said she wanted a nanny who would supervise her baby, feed her and put her to bed, \u201cbasically all the tasks that [a] mother does\u201d","11228":"She added that most importantly, she wanted a nanny to look after her baby so she could tend to other household chores \u2014 which has us shook; you would think the ONE time mothers are asked about themselves, they would prioritise themselves, instead of thinking about chores","11229":"","11230":"Leave it to moms and mom-figures to only think about working to make their family\u2019s lives better","11231":"It is (going to be) Mother\u2019s Day and we strongly believe moms should not do any household tasks on such a sacred day","11232":"Another thing mothers really want","11233":"Your love \u2014 and that costs literally nothing","11234":"A mom of an eight-year-old said she wanted a handwritten note declaring how much her child loved her and why","11235":"Not only does that sound super sweet, it\u2019s perfect for the age demographic","11236":"I\u2019m sure moms can be the only people who cherish young children\u2019s art; it\u2019s called \u201cunconditional love\u201d for a reason","11237":"A mother of two teenage girls, on the other hand, said she \u201ccraves the feeling of being essential and cherished once more\u201d","11238":"\u201cWhile I cherish their independence, I long for reassurance from them","11239":"\u201d She added that material gifts did hold some significance, and she preferred small, meaningful presents sprinkled throughout the day rather than one grand gesture","11240":"I\u2019m going to take a moment here to say it sounds scary to be the mother of not one, but TWO teenagers","11241":"It\u2019s like having the pretty, popular kids from school live with you","11242":"\u201cYou want to hang","11243":"\u201d \u201cNo","11244":"\u201d \u201cYou want to get some lunch","11245":"\u201d \u201cNo","11246":"\u201d \u201cWe could go out","11247":"\u201d \u201cNo","11248":"\u201d\u201cPlus I want their father to know that he got the best mother for his kids he could possibly ask,\u201d she added","11249":"My aunt, who has a 30-year-old daughter, maintained that material things were not for her at all","11250":"\u201cI would want nothing more than the happiness of my child, and seeing them happy and relaxed is my goal","11251":"But the one thing I do want is for them to eat the food I have cooked and enjoy it","11252":"Nothing is more comforting and fulfilling for a mother than some time spent with her children\u201d","11253":"Food is a reccurring theme, maybe because a lot of our mothers spend so much of their time and effort slaving away over the stove","11254":"A mother of three aged 18, 23 and 26 said she wanted all three of her kids to cook something for her separately, before quickly adding that she did not want that from her 18-year-old because she has exams","11255":"Once again, leave it to moms to worry about their children, even when they\u2019re asked what they want","11256":"A quick pasta recipe won\u2019t take more than 30 minutes, which is the perfect break from studying \u2014 don\u2019t forget your mom did EVERYTHING with you inside her for nine months, and then clung to her hip for years","11257":"Time to repay her for you basically being a little parasite","11258":"However, the best answer came from a mother of a 15 and an 18-year-old:\u201cAs a mother, I want kids who are like dogs \u2014 they don\u2019t answer back, wag their tails to greet you and are happy no matter what the treat is","11259":"Not this teenage attitude, shattitude","11260":"\u201d LOL","11261":"A mother of a four-year-old and a newborn baby said people should, at the very least, acknowledge everything mothers do and all the sacrifices they make, even if they do not support the mom because for mothers \u201ceverything is happening all at once\u201d","11262":"She also joked that she would like some peace as well to enjoy a cup of tea or a meal, and as she was speaking her child could be heard in the background","11263":"\u201cThis","11264":"We want to be able to do one thing without interruptions","11265":"\u201d \n\nBeing a mother cannot be easy, and one of the biggest stresses they face is the situation of the country they are raising their children in","11266":"A Dawn staffer, who is the mother of a two-year-old, told me that mothers, by virtue of motherhood, do not think of their own selves and always have their child on their mind","11267":"She said that she wanted the very best for her daughter and nothing for herself","11268":"\u201cI constantly think of the future of the country she lives in and what I can do to give my child the very best chance at life in Pakistan","11269":"What I would want is to see my child grow and thrive, and for my efforts to be paid off","11270":"\u201dAnother young mom, with an 18-month-old daughter, said she wished a fairy godmother would come to Pakistan and make it a safer place for children, and that her child\u2019s safety and security were the only things that worried her after she became a mother","11271":"Australian social worker Shaniera Akram, who is based in Karachi, had a special message for Mother\u2019s Day:\u201cTo all the mothers out there, whether they are mothers who have given birth, adopted or become stepmothers, our job is all-consuming","11272":"There is no off button","11273":"We are on the job 24\/7 and it is hard but what we get out of it is more rewarding than any you can ever ask for","11274":"We get to say at the end of the day, \u2018we did that, we raised them and they are amazing\u2019","11275":"That\u2019s the biggest gift you can get as a mother","11276":"\u201dSo ditch the motia scented candle \u2014 I won\u2019t be though, my mother is definitely getting the candle she wants \u2014 and the basic kurta","11277":"Chances are, your mom, no matter how old you are, wants some peace, some love and maybe some pampering","11278":"Now that we have equipped you with all this information, go forth and make this the perfect Mother\u2019s Day","11279":"We would recommend some breakfast in bed (for your mom, not by her), some quality time with her and then some rest and relaxation for her while you look after everyday chores","11280":"Happy Mother\u2019s Day to all mother-figures (and best of luck with your kids)","11281":"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX)

2","11333":"57 million hectares to 3","11334":"62m hectares \u2014 reflecting a substantial growth of 40 per cent","11335":"During the same period, total rice production surged by 46pc, from 6","11336":"2m tonnes to 9m tonnes (provisional estimates of the United States Department of Agriculture for 2023-24)","11337":"In fact, the actual rice acreage is even greater than what government statistics report for the Kharif crop, as they don\u2019t account for a recent trend in some districts where farmers are planting two rice crops from mid-April to mid-November \u2014 within a single Kharif season \u2014 under wheat-rice-rice, potato-rice-rice, and other cropping systems","11338":"The new short-duration basmati (Kissan basmati) and coarse hybrid rice varieties, which mature in under 90 days, have made this possible","11339":"However, there is another side to this story","11340":"The ongoing increase in rice cultivation is outpacing available surface water, which is diminishing due to dam sedimentation","11341":"Consequently, indiscriminate groundwater extraction is increasing with each passing day, resulting in a continual drop in the water table","11342":"This not only degrades the quality of irrigation water but also necessitates greater energy to pump water from deeper depths","11343":"Govt must look into short to medium term water management as surging rice farming and depleting ground water may lead to serious environment consequencesIn the past, the government\u2019s flat-rate tariff (fixed monthly bill) for tube wells encouraged excessive groundwater pumping","11344":"Likewise, the recent rapid transition to solar-powered tube wells enables farmers to operate them without restraint, which will eventually intensify the strain on already dwindling groundwater resources","11345":"In Pakistan, groundwater remains unregulated","11346":"Last year, the Punjab Irrigation Department tried to discourage rice cultivation by announcing a much higher abiyana (canal water charges) on rice farmers compared to other crops like wheat, gram, oil seeds, and cotton effective in 2024","11347":"The government\u2019s reasoning for this rate increase is that, while all crops receive the same canal water allocation, rice farmers are pumping much more groundwater","11348":"In fact, Pakistan\u2019s unsustainable usage of groundwater is causing a lot of concerns within environmentalist groups","11349":"With this context, it\u2019s essential to reflect on how Pakistan can reconcile conflicting priorities of managing dwindling water resources while simultaneously expanding or at least sustaining rice exports, especially in the short to medium-term, until the economy rebounds","11350":"It is worth noting that Pakistan has a very limited exportable surplus in its agriculture and food export group, comprising mainly rice, maize, sesame, mangoes, dates, citrus, ethanol (derived from sugarcane), and potatoes","11351":"Among these, rice is currently the largest item","11352":"The Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan is optimistic, based on the first six months\u2019 export figures, that rice exports will reach a record 5m tonnes in FY24, amounting to $3 billion","11353":"Restricting the area under rice \u2014 the second largest crop after wheat \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem feasible at the moment, particularly given that climate change and erratic rains during the Kharif season have reduced cotton cultivation, leading to an increase in rice area, along with maize and sugarcane","11354":"The ongoing increase in rice cultivation is outpacing available surface water, which is diminishing due to dam sedimentationMoreover, since rice is a major staple food in Pakistan, second only to wheat, a drop in production could increase wheat dependency, potentially triggering a new wave of food inflation","11355":"A potential solution is to enhance the country\u2019s water storage capacity","11356":"Undoubtedly, there is currently no substitute for dams","11357":"However, in the short to medium term, we need to manage existing water resources effectively by focusing on four key areas: reducing water conveyance losses, improving water-use efficiency, enhancing crop water productivity, and recharging groundwater","11358":"In regards to improving water-use efficiency and water productivity of rice fields, three recent developments involving increased use of laser land levellers, adoption of short-duration rice varieties, and greater usage of high-yielding hybrid varieties have been very positive","11359":"Despite these, our water usage is still in the range of 1,200mm - 2,000mm compared to the rice crop\u2019s actual requirements of about 700 mm of water","11360":"Such excessive water wastage and low crop yields result in a water productivity of just 0","11361":"23 kilogram rice per cubic meter (kg\/m3) in comparison with the world average of 0","11362":"79 kg\/m3","11363":"These inefficiencies highlight the short\u00ad\u00adcomings of our continuous-flooding irrigation practices, and flawed rice planting techniques, resulting in unsustainable rice production","11364":"There is a great need to promote water-saving and eco-friendly rice production","11365":"Over past years, the government has tried to promote direct seeded rice (DSR) and bed planting techniques to save water, but these resulted in lower crop yields and failed to gain traction among farmers","11366":"However, there are several other international best-practices and techniques that have delivered notable results in other countries","11367":"By learning from their experiences and success stories, we can improve the knowledge and skills of our own farmers","11368":"Unfortunately, groundwater recharge, especially at the farmer\u2019s level, has always been neglected in Pakistan","11369":"Each year, an excessive amount of rainwater flows through fields, into drains, and then into rivers, ultimately reaching the sea","11370":"This water could otherwise be used to recharge underground aquifers","11371":"Such rainwater harvesting could also help reduce the risk of flooding during the monsoon season","11372":"Rice exports are undoubtedly crucial in reducing Pakistan\u2019s growing trade deficit","11373":"Yet, they also have colossal environmental consequences, as each kilogram of rice exported carries around 4,500 litres of embedded (hidden) water","11374":"Our record rice exports in FY24 are largely attributed to India\u2019s July 2023 ban on exporting its non-basmati rice","11375":"However, this situation may not persist in the future","11376":"Will our exporters be able to export the same quantity in the coming years","11377":"If not, a market glut caused by overproduction may ruin rice farmers","11378":"Khalid Wattoo is a farmer and a development professional, and Dr Waqar Ahmad is a former Associate Professor at the University of Agriculture,

Koreans was vastly different, especially because of Pakistanis\u2019 predilection for arriving late; she said people would often arrive hours after the call time, causing a delay in the entire day\u2019s events","11538":"\u201cIt was more difficult to be taken seriously as a woman when I was handling everything","11539":"They didn\u2019t take me that seriously","11540":"They take men seriously","11541":"\u201dShe recalled that while shooting the Biltzers music video, the security team disappeared suddenly because they weren\u2019t given food and tea","11542":"But when Tiwana showed up and appeared to be angry, he was afforded more respect","11543":"Behind-the-scenes issues aside, Kim told me that the team from Netflix Korean loved Pakistan and Pakistani hospitality, and wanted to come back","11544":"She added that Korean celebrities were now messaging her about wanting to visit Pakistan too","11545":"\u201cLet\u2019s go [to Pakistan], let\u2019s do something,\u201d she quoted her famous friends","11546":"Who knows, maybe your favourite K-pop idol will be roaming the streets of Lahore, and you will have only Anna Kim to thank","11547":"While Kim feels she fulfilled her goal of portraying a positive Pakistan, she is also aware of the backlash and trolling she has been receiving from Pakistani people because of the \u2018super rich\u2019 tag","11548":"\u201cIn Korea, we had the lowest hate,\u201d she said as Korean audiences saw a different version of Pakistan and believed Kim and her husband to be very humble","11549":"View this post on Instagram            \n\u201cAll over the world, the reviews are good,\u201d she said, though she knows there are some people in Pakistan who may be poking fun at the wording in the show, particularly the word \u201cnobleman\u201d","11550":"She reiterated that she was indeed Korean and perhaps should\u2019ve only spoken Korean throughout the show because people thought she was Pakistani because she spoke English","11551":"Kim emphasised that while Super Rich in Korea was indeed a reality show, there was an element of editing and scripting involved in the process and urged audiences to \u201cenjoy the show as a show\u201d","11552":"She narrated that at one point in the second episode, she spoke about not knowing what properties her husband has, however, the subtitles read that she does not know how many vacation homes her family has","11553":"\u201cI tried my best to show Pakistan positively","11554":"The embassy in Korea was so happy with me","11555":"\u201dKim said she was not being targeted on her Instagram account, and in fact, Pakistani celebrities had messaged her saying they were proud of her for showing a good side of Pakistan","11556":"\u201cI am running an NGO, I did my best to not do paisa, paisa [money, money] and not carry a Herm\u00e8s bag","11557":"I [however] did not expect to get backlash on my home","11558":"\u201dKim doesn\u2019t want people to get it mixed up \u2014 she didn\u2019t get the role in this show because of her husband\u2019s familial wealth, it was because of her own achievements in Korea","11559":"\u201cI don\u2019t want people to get it wrong that I married in [to] this royal family","11560":"Later, they [Netflix] got to know I married in [to] this family","11561":"If you see the characters, only I had the story from my childhood","11562":"They put my elementary picture, middle school, high school, and all the work I have done","11563":"I got married, so I have to show my family [because] that\u2019s my family","11564":"\u201d \n\nShe underscored that people\u2019s ideas that she was on the show because she\u2019s \u2018royalty\u2019 were \u201cwrong\u201d and that she just wanted to show Pakistan\u2019s \u201cbeautiful culture\u201d that she discovered after her marriage","11565":"Kim lamented people\u2019s vicious rumours and their disbelief that she could bring Netflix to Pakistan","11566":"She also denied rumours that Netflix paid her family millions to shoot the show","11567":"\u201cIt was very sad when people weren\u2019t believing [me], [they asked] \u2018who is this girl, how can she bring [Netflix to Pakistan]\u2019","11568":"\u201d Despite the setbacks, Kim wants to do her best to promote Pakistan and prove that she can take the country\u2019s image to a different level","11569":"Kim would initially promote Korean culture, she used to be an ambassador for Korean tourism and was a Korean traditional model","11570":"However, in the show, she was very careful to promote Pakistan instead","11571":"She wore Pakistani designers instead of Western fashion and featured the iconic designer Mohsin Naveed Ranjha on the show","11572":"\u201cI wanted to show the Pakistani fashion industry and Pakistani makeup \u2014 if you see\u2026 in Korea, my makeup and my clothes are totally different [and] in Pakistan it is totally different","11573":"So I tried to show the Pakistani beauty and fashion to everybody that lives in Korea,\u201d she explained","11574":"Kim is truly a cross-cultural ambassador, putting in immense effort to promote Pakistan in Korea and vice versa","11575":"During the interview, she informed me that she is launching her own Korean beauty brand, complete with Korean partners and Korean technicians who have been living in Pakistan for the past six months","11576":"All of this is an effort to introduce authentic Korean beauty products in Pakistan","11577":"\u201cThere are many Korean beauty brands in Pakistan right now\u2026 honestly, those are the products elementary school, and high school students are using in Korea","11578":"So, I want to do affordable price products with premium quality that we really use in Korea","11579":"We are going to make a Korea[n] beauty lab in Pakistan","11580":"\u201dIt doesn\u2019t end at makeup, Kim\u2019s brother and her husband are now going to work together to export Pakistani mangoes to Korea for the first time ever","11581":"Kim also wants to bring her Korean NGO, Melting Pot, to Pakistan in an effort to work for the betterment of Pakistani people","11582":"She has her heart set on bringing her teams and setting up a proper NGO to work not just for Pakistan, but also Palestine which has been decimated after Israel amped up its aggression in Gaza","11583":"\u201cI have some friends who are doing a great job for Palestine in Pakistan","11584":"So, I\u2019m trying to send donations from Korea and Pakistan to Palestine","11585":"\u201dOf course, I had to know if Kim and the other cast members were actually friends behind the scenes or if the hangouts were just for show, as reality TV can often be scripted","11586":"Lo-and-behold, she told me that they were all actually really good friends","11587":"\u201cNoor is a really good friend of mine,\u201d she said","11588":"And the \u2018Top 1% in Singapore\u2019 David Yong","11589":"He wants to come to Pakistan","11590":"\u201cDavid Yong wants to come to Pakistan and said he enjoyed my husband\u2019s part in the show the most","11591":"He wants to meet the lions","11592":"It looks [like we\u2019re] showing off, but it\u2019s [a] very different culture","11593":"So, he wants to come to Pakistan and see life here","11594":"\u201dShe also detailed that her other cast mates want to do business in Pakistan, with Yong wanting to bring a music festival to Pakistan, and Italian fashion prodigy Teodoro Marani wanting to bring non-alcoholic beverages","11595":"Perhaps this is why we should never underestimate the strength of soft-power politics, having a Pakistani cultural ambassador among the \u2018super rich\u2019 in Korea can be beneficial for the local economy if Pakistan plays its cards right","11596":"I saved the best question for last, the one that plagued me the most while I watched the show \u2014 did her husband get his Korean visa yet","11597":"With a loud chuckle, Kim clarified that his visa was denied due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and prior to the pandemic, his visa had been approved but he was unable to visit in the allotted time","11598":"And now","11599":"He just had to reapply","11600":"\u201cHe can go to Korea anytime and can get [the] visa","11601":"\u201d she repeated to me over text","11602":"Good to know","11603":"We\u2019re excited

encompasses approximately 280 days spent by the foetus inside the mother, in addition to the first two years of life","12098":"Insufficient nutrition during these 1,000 days is detrimental to the long-term growth and development of a child and thus places them at a disadvantaged position right from the start, depriving them of a fair opportunity at optimal development","12099":"However, it is

in this area for over a decade","12115":"Initially, her work focused on child health, specifically examining infectious diseases and noting that adverse outcomes and treatment failures were prevalent among small children","12116":"This observation prompted them to initiate The Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement (AMANHI) study, revealing that infants born small tended to remain small and malnourished","12117":"This realisation raised questions about the necessity of intervening during pregnancy","12118":"Subsequently, they observed that malnourished pregnant women were more likely to give birth to small babies, either due to prematurity or low birth weight","12119":"They began interventions targeting anaemia, starting with iron supplementation","12120":"Their efforts included door-to-door surveillance for anaemia in pregnancy and providing iron supplementation, including IV iron for severe cases \u2014 a novel approach for these communities, where such treatments were typically inaccessible outside tertiary care centres","12121":"Therefore, the focus of health stakeholders has shifted from children under five, to newborn health to now the mother, she said","12122":"\u201cSupplements are ideally for severely malnourished individuals in emergency cases","12123":"For example, if someone has a vitamin D deficiency, they can fulfil that requirement by taking a capsule,\u201d said Dr Ahmed","12124":"\u201cIdeally, you should be getting that from food or sunlight","12125":"\u201cHowever, for most, that is not the reality in Pakistan therefore, they

in rural areas than in urban centres, he said","12132":"In Rehri Goth, the \u201cmajority work, in community management, is to [first] classify the children based on criteria whether they are moderately malnourished or severely malnourished","12133":"Similarly, the mother gets classified as malnourished on either the BMI (body mass index) or the mid-arm upper circumference,\u201d stated Dr

(BNP) facilities across Sindh","12149":"They require registration and an antenatal checkup at a government faculty","12150":"\u201cEven though MMS is not easily available, there is a clear plan to introduce it soon,\u201d Dr Jehan added","12151":"But are supplements enough","12152":"The simple answer is no","12153":"\u201cIf nutrition could solve the issue, it would be really easy","12154":"But there are many other vulnerabilities in these women","12155":"For example, we live in an area where, mostly in low and middle-income countries like Pakistan, the environment is not clean","12156":"Right","12157":"\u201d Dr Jehan asked rhetorically","12158":"There\u2019s a lot of exposure to pathogens","12159":"Pathogens | A pathogen is defined as an organism causing disease to its host","12160":"Populations that are \u201cchronically exposed\u201d to pathogens develop a \u201cmechanism\u201d where they don\u2019t get sick but experience \u201ca low level of illness\u201d","12161":"\u201cWhat happens is that these bacteria go in our colon and start increasing [in number] and become colonised in our guts, causing inflammation,\u201d the doctor explained","12162":"\u201cInflammation means, for example, if you have a pimple, there\u2019s redness, heat, and pain","12163":"That\u2019s a low level of inflammation which affects every system of your body,\u201d she said","12164":"Therefore, when a woman gets pregnant and has inflammation in her body, she is more likely to have other pregnancy-related problems","12165":"\u201cThe most commonly used food supplement, BEP, has shown mixed results \u2014 some women respond to it, some don\u2019t,\u201d Dr Jehan said","12166":"One of the reasons for the non-response is inflammation","12167":"\u201cEven if you provide these women with supplements, you don\u2019t have the bacteria that helps them process the food","12168":"\u201cJust giving supplements is also problematic because we don\u2019t want to give them only empty calories,\u201d she stated","12169":"\u201cThis is what we call the hidden malnutrition where the person appears to be of good weight but is malnourished","12170":"\u201d \n\nA woman at the medicine counter in Rehri Goth on March 19, 2024","12171":"\u2014 Rahim Sajwani\/Paediatrics & Child Health, AKUH\n\u201cThe cause of death in most infectious diseases is malnutrition","12172":"It\u2019s not the infection that kills, but the underlying vulnerability,\u201d the doctor added","12173":"Another concerning issue is that children under five relapse after being provided with nutrients","12174":"A study by The Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition (CHAIN) Network has shown that about 40pc of children discharged from the hospital after treatment for malnourishment die in the next two years in Pakistan","12175":"Earlier, stakeholders in the healthcare sector prioritised lowering the mortality rate of newborn babies globally, Dr Nisar said","12176":"The focus then shifted to improving nutrition","12177":"Now, improved neurodevelopment of children \u2014 how many of them go to schools, how many get jobs as adults, and what is their potential for economic development \u2014 has become the centre of concern","12178":"Dr Jehan and Dr Nisar have conducted trials where they introduced additional elements to supplements and assessed their impact","12179":"These trials primarily focus on outcomes relevant to children","12180":"For instance, when administering to pregnant mothers, the baby\u2019s weight becomes a crucial factor","12181":"Similarly, when providing it to lactating mothers, it\u2019s essential to monitor the baby\u2019s growth over six months","12182":"Dr Nisar explained that malnourished women were enrolled in the trial setting, as per certain criteria, where they were given supplements as \u201cstandard of care\u201d, along with other elements","12183":"Courtesy: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\n\u201cOne of them is azithromycin, an antibiotic","12184":"The full biological mechanism of how it works is not completely understood but it has some beneficial effects for immunity,\u201d he added","12185":"Azithromycin | It is from a group of medicines called macrolide antibiotics that work by killing the bacteria that cause the infection","12186":"It improves one\u2019s microbiome by killing harmful bacteria in the gut","12187":"\u201cIt defies logic somewhat","12188":"You give two doses of azithromycin [to the mother] and the baby\u2019s weight at the time of birth is somehow better,\u201d he said","12189":"Microbiome | The body is home to trillions of microorganisms known as the microbiome","12190":"However, there is \u201chuge opposition\u201d to the use of the drug","12191":"Antimicrobial resistance groups have expressed concern about the widespread usage of antibiotics","12192":"They particularly emphasise the importance of preserving azithromycin as \u201cone of the last resort drugs\u201d effective against extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid","12193":"They argue that implementing it on a large scale might lead to overuse and further resistance to development, according to Dr Nisar","12194":"In response, he acknowledged that antibiotics, including azithromycin, are already widely prescribed \u201cday and night\u201d","12195":"However, he stressed that targeting specific populations such as pregnant women and malnourished individuals, could significantly improve newborn outcomes with minimal impact on overall resistance levels","12196":"He noted that this intervention involves only two doses, mitigating the risk of widespread resistance","12197":"Despite this, concerns remain due to the strong influence of the antibiotic lobby","12198":"The current WHO recommendation is that if a country\u2019s neonatal mortality rate is very high, one dose of azithromycin to children can be given annually","12199":"It works like a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d, Dr Nisar described","12200":"A woman getting her blood pressure checked at Rehri Goth clinic in November 2023","12201":"\u2014 Rayhan Muqadam\/Paediatrics & Child Health, AKUH\nSince azithromycin is still considered somewhat of a \u201ctaboo\u201d, they are going for BEP, MMS, and MMS plus, said Dr Nisar","12202":"\u201cMMS plus is also something which has not been used anywhere","12203":"They have been in trials for 20 years, but their recommendations have not been adopted by anyone","12204":"They are beneficial, but till now, it is not a universal adoption","12205":"\u201cWhat we are saying is that instead of MMS, MMS plus which contains nicotinamide and other things [choline] that have an additional beneficial effect, should be given,\u201d he added","12206":"Nutritional support for pregnant women with or without Azithromycin to improve birth outcomes in Pakistan (Results)\n\u2014 AKUH\nEven though RUSF and RU2F are nutritious, he continued, better results are seen when they are accompanied by azithromycin and MMS","12207":"\u201cThis means they are working through some other pathway","12208":"So one of the postulated pathways is through the microbiome","12209":"Because you eat food and pass it to the baby but if your microbiome is not optimal, it will not necessarily get absorbed","12210":"\u201cYou have to have a healthy gut environment as well","12211":"The gut of mothers and children in low and middle-income countries like ours is in a state called dysbiosis,\u201d Dr Nisar stated","12212":"Dysbiosis | An imbalance in the microbiome of an individual, often leading to disease","12213":"What they are striving to achieve through various interventions is the restoration of the gut microbiome\u2019s healthy state","12214":"This enables nutritional interventions and other measures to function more effectively","12215":"The clinic at Rehri Goth, AKUH\u2019s oldest and most well-established site, is also the most socioeconomically disadvantaged","12216":"\u201cWe have implemented some recent projects in collaboration with other partners, where we have seen a significant decline in mortality there,\u201d the doctor highlighted","12217":"Children of Rehri Goth on Marcy 19, 2024","12218":"\u2014 Rahim Sajwani\/Paediatrics & Child Health, AKUH\n\u201cWe started with children under the age of five years","12219":"Their mortality rate was around 100 per 1,000 live births, which means that for every 10 children, one died before their fifth birthday","12220":"And we have brought it down to around 50","12221":"We also decreased the neonatal mortality rate from approximately 40 to 20","12222":"\u201dDespite the substantial interest and investment from global stakeholders, the true measure of these interventions lies in whether average malnourished women like Kiran, Bushra, and Shazia can lead healthy lives and give birth to healthy babies","12223":"\u201cNutrition is not a health issue, it is a multi-sectoral issue,\u201d said Dr Ahmed","12224":"\u201cThe government needs to take the lead \u2014 the private and industrial sectors can only fill the gaps","12225":"\u201cThe role of the community and its women becomes paramount since their lives are ultimately at stake","12226":"Even if supplements enable them to have healthy pregnancies, the issue of hunger remains, as noted by Dr Jehan","12227":"The goal is not only to provide adequate nourishment but also to alleviate hunger","12228":"Can a pill or supplement ever replace a good hearty meal shared with family","12229":"There is an urgent need for all relevant stakeholders, including state-level bodies, private and government sectors, and community members, to intervene and halt the perpetuation of socioeconomic inequality in society","12230":"\u201cWe need to fix the economic problems","12231":"If we don\u2019t improve poverty and help alleviate [people\u2019s situations], how will they [afford] to eat","12232":"\u201d said the NGO head","12233":"Why should Shazia make \u201csacrifices\u201d while feeding her two- and four-year-old children","12234":"Why can\u2019t she have a balanced meal of potatoes, tomatoes as well as meat","12235":"Even after receiving much-needed supplements, what about the constant stress Shazia endures daily due to her inability to adequately feed her children","12236":"It\u2019s easy to blame individual women from disadvantaged backgrounds for having multiple children, suggesting they brought their struggles upon themselves","12237":"\u201cWhy did they have multiple children if they lack resources","12238":"\u201dBut is it fair that those with more resources can have as many children as they want while individuals like Shazia face societal judgment regarding their reproductive choices","12239":"This isn\u2019t to disregard the need for family planning in our country, but to put the onus of the abysmal healthcare system on individual women\u2019s reproductive choices is not fair","12240":"It is about time that the narrative shifts from blaming women from disadvantaged classes for giving birth to multiple children to understanding how societal structures can move towards a more egalitarian way of living","12241":"Header image created with AI","12242":"WASHINGTON: Lawmakers
